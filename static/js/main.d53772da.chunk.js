This essay continues his work with a focus on hasidic scriptural exegetical texts, the derashot. I will argue that Hasidic derashot exemplify active interpretation, and the intimate personal engagement of the inter- preter. While mystical receptivity is indeed cultivated, there is also active intervention and deliberate recontextualization. The charismatic hasidic interpreter embraces sacred scripture in a dynamic personal relationship, with the belief that the recontextu- alizing and renewed understanding of verses changes reality itself, moving all in the direction of compassion and beneficence. This interpretive posture of personal rela- tionship is grounded in a robust individualism that differs from the quest for Ayin, the Nothing or Absolute, that has often been emphasized by many scholars of Hasidism.",h.a.createElement("br",null),h.a.createElement("br",null)),h.a.createElement("div",{className:"PDFBody"},"Israel ben Eliezer (d. 1760), known as the Baal Shem Tov and considered by devotees as the founder of Hasidism, taught that every word of Torah can sustain two opposing interpretations, one pointing in the direction of severity, and one pointing toward compassion, or the notion that \u201cthe righteous transform the sense of severity to that of compassion.\u201d",h.a.createElement("span",{className:"SuperScript"},"2"),"\xa0\xa0   For the Baal Shem Tov, the spiritual integrity of the interpreter is more important than intellectual skill or knowledge of the canon.

On the other hand, \u201cWhen one learns from a wicked person, then [even though the message may be correct] it is not fruitful and does not multiply, but remains flat, just as the student learned it.\u201d",h.a.createElement("span",{className:"SuperScript"},"4"),"\xa0\xa0 In a companion teaching, the Baal Shem Tov argues a complementary point: The Torah\u2019s many commandments (613 according to talmudic tradition) can all be distilled to the Ten Commandments, and these in turn are rooted in just one word, the Anokhi, the \u201cI am\u201d that opens the Decalogue.

Weiss, 1998), 468\u201369, in which the Seven Pillars of Secular Wisdom are palace treasures visible to all, hence seized by \u2018servants,\u2019 while the deep treasure, understood as religious piety, is hidden by the king in the palace walls. The favored son, having been alerted in advance by the king, is able to notice a slight irregularity in the wall, which he proceeds to demolish, and uncovers the hidden treasure. In Rabbi Jacob Joseph\u2019s parable (which he attributes to an ambiguously identified \u201cMoharaz\u201d), there is once again the contrast between the beloved son and the servants, who evidently do not enjoy the same level of intimacy with the king. In addition, the game is stacked in favor of the son, because he is told ahead of time of the existence of the most precious treasure, while the servants\u2014oblivious to the existence of any hidden treasure\u2014have no chance of finding it.Hasidic Derashah as Illuminated Exegesis 65",h.a.createElement("br",null),h.a.createElement("br",null)),h.a.createElement("div",{className:"PDFBodyFN"},"32  \x07Ps. 78:25, as understood by many ancient and modern interpreters.",h.a.createElement("br",null),h.a.createElement("br",null)),h.a.createElement("div",{className:"PDFBodyFN"},"33  \x07Tractate Vayissa 3; see Mekilta de-Rabbi Ishmael vol. 2, ed.

The stories of a particular lineage encapsulated the collec- tive wisdom of the school where they were told and the dynasty that preserved them. Tales pointed to core hasidic values as embodied in the life of the court. When the in- di vidual Hasid reached a situation similar to that of the tale in some respect, he may have heard in the tale the voice of his rebbe, providing inspiration and encourage- ment as well as perspective and direction. The guidance received from a tale thus as- sisted the Hasid to act with wisdom and integrity, consistent with the ethos and values of the lineage to which he was affiliated. For example, stories in the Chabad- Lubavitch school tend to emphasize Torah knowledge, Divine omnipresence, and uncompromis- ing fearlessness in carrying out the will of God as understood by the rebbe. The combi- nation of talmudic scholasticism, contemplation of divine immanence, and militancy in praxis create the characteristic profile of Chabad Hasidism, and this signature is re- flected in Chabad\u2019s fund of stories and tales. In this way, the function of the hasidic tale, the function of the court, and the function of the zaddik vis- \xe0- vis the Hasid dove- tailed and mutually reinforced each other. The rebbe told the tales and embodied their wisdom, while the shtetl became the destination around which the tales turned and where they would be heard most authentically and fully. Each dynasty\u2019s storehouse of hasidic tales helped define its identity in the constellation of the hasidic world.

Throughout the nineteenth century hasidic centers fostered a protected domain where a quiet and unhurried Hasidism could flourish, luxuriating in a sacred space far from the pace and pressures of urban life.

The question then became, can a hasidic lineage survive the physical dislocation of the rebbe and then the destruction of the Jewish residents of the town whose name the lineage bears? The answer to this question depended on the fate of the zaddik himself. In general the corporate identity of a hasidic community does not long survive without direct personal contact with a living master. With the living master, there is stability and continuity, a natural focus for the community\u2019s efforts to regroup and rebuild. Almost without exception, it was only when a dynastic scion sur- vived the war that a particular hasidic community was able to reconstitute itself. The postwar hasidic leaders who survived the Shoah and relocated to West ern Europe, Is- rael, or the West ern hemisphere saved the cohesive communities built by their ances- tors from dissipation. Crystallized around family loyalty and the memory of great pre- decessors, the community\u2019s identity remained intact.

In this period, the lineage\u2019s story (now in clud ing the story of war trauma and survival) and the person who embodies the story mutually reinforce each other as never before. The dynastic narrative (re)constructs the place where the dynasty began, thus giving the incumbent rebbe his identity and his mission.

Jeremy Dauber has shown convincingly that early hasidic stories generally avoid realistic rep- resentation of spatial location. He argues that the reason for eschewing mimetic representation is ideological: \u201crepresentation, description at a distance, mediated texts, is no substitute for direct con- tact with the Zaddik . . . , who is able to perceive \u2018the real truth\u2019 and to articulate it.\u201d Jeremy Dauber, \u201cLooking at the Yiddish Landscape: Representation in Nineteenth- Century Hasidic and Maskilic Lit- erature,\u201d in Shtetl: New Evaluations, ed.

Steven Katz has written of the need for attending to the role (that is, the social function) of re- telling tales in hasidic life, as well as considering the differences between the vari ous hasidic lineages.

Joseph Dan, in The Hasidic Story\u2014 Its History and Development [in Hebrew] (Jerusalem: Keter, 1975), 235\u201338, distinguishes between collections of hasidic tales pub- lished by maskilim and other \u201coutsiders,\u201d in contrast to tales collected and published by \u201cinsiders.\u201d These latter tend to focus on one lineage\u2014 the one of which the editor is an adherent. These efforts, Dan observes, are in effect monographs on the lineage and its masters, tend to downplay the miracu- lous and fabulous, and contain much of solid his tori cal value. It may be added that these collections tend to highlight the wisdom of the particular lineage\u2019s masters as captured in their aphorisms and parables, and the vignettes told about them. 12. Wiesel, Somewhere a Master: Further Hasidic Portraits and Legends (New York: Summit Books, 1982), 175; emphasis and formatting mine. I have attempted to hear these words as they likely were spoken by their author; it should be recalled that most of the published essays were delivered orally, and that the poetic cadences\u2014 and silences\u2014 are an important aspect of Wiesel\u2019s powerful eloquence. 13. There is a similar pattern in Souls on Fire where the chapter called \u201cThe School of Pshyshke\u201d comes after ten chapters whose headings name an early master or his disciples. 14. On this see A. Wertheim, Law and Custom in Chassidism [in Hebrew] (Jerusalem: Mossad Harav Kook, 1960). 15. The role of hasidic masters in orchestrating melody during prayer services was noted by the early anti- hasidic polemicist David of Makov. Writing about Rabbi Hayyim- Heikel and his court in Amdur during the years 1773\u201387, he quotes an enthusiast as follows: \u201cOur Rebbe has a very sweet voice and knows how to sing songs as do all those who pray with him. . . . Our master Heike\u2019s honey- toned melodies are surpassingly pleasing. He beats time with both his hands, clapping them together, as [the hasidim] respond in harmonious chorus.\u201d See Mordecai Wilensky, Hasidim and Mitnaggedim, vol. 2 (Jerusalem: Bialik Institute, 1990), 173; Wolf Zeev Rabinowitsch, Lithuanian Hasidism (New York: Schocken Books, 1971), 128.

The displacement of Abraham Joshua Heschel\u2019s aristocratic hasidic family from the country- side to major cities such as Vienna and Warsaw during the Great War is described by Edward Kaplan and Samuel Dresner in Abraham Joshua Heschel: Prophetic Witness (New Haven, Conn.: Yale Uni- versity Press, 1998). See esp. 34 on the relocation of Heschel\u2019s uncle, Rabbi Alter Israel Shimon Per- low, to Warsaw. Throughout his Warsaw years until his death in 1933, this saintly fig ure was known as the \u201cNovominsker Rebbe.\u201d 17. Joseph Dan has noted that the main factor securing the miraculous contemporary rebirth of hasidic communities in the aftermath of the Holocaust was \u201cadherence to their hereditary tzad- dikim.\u201d See Joseph Dan, \u201cHasidism: The Third Century,\u201d in Jewish Mysticism, vol. 4: General Charac- teristics and Comparative Studies (Northvale, N.J.: Jason Aronson, 1999), 67\u201385; \u201cThe Contemporary Hasidic Tzaddik: Charisma, Heredity, Magic, and Miracle,\u201d ibid., 111\u201330. 18. The fate of Alexander (Alexandrov, near Lodz) Hasidism is instructive as a counterexample. Before the Second World War, it was one of the largest hasidic groups in Poland, rivaling Ger in num-Yearning for bers and influence. But while the Gerer rebbe escaped to Eretz Israel and began the rebuilding of his community, almost all the Danziger heirs were killed, and Alexander has to this day not recovered its former prominence.

The story, told by the rabbi of Bluzhov, Rabbi Israel Spira, is one of survival by means of a seemingly impossible feat, jumping over a large, yawning pit. The frail rabbi and a friend close their eyes, jump, and make it to the other side alive. As Eliach tells the story, the rabbi\u2019s young friend asks him: \u201cTell me, Rebbe, how did you do it?\u201d \u201cI was holding on to my ancestral merit. I was holding on to the coattails of my father, and my grandfather and my great- grandfather, of blessed memory,\u201d said the rabbi and his eyes searched the black skies above. \u201cTell me, my friend, how did you reach the other side of the pit?\u201d \u201cI was holding on to you,\u201d replied the rabbi\u2019s friend.

Elliot R. Wolfson has made an important contribution to our appreciation of the depth, subtlety, and power of Rabbi Schneerson\u2019s thought with his Open Secret: Postmessianic Messianism and the Mystical Revision of Menahem Mendel Schneerson (New York: Columbia University Press, 2009).

A death that was life for evermore. The last eight verses, and by extension the entire Torah, become a completion cycle and a love letter.

The tradition of ascribing profound emotions to God was largely neglected or suppressed by the medieval Jewish philosophers. Such great thinkers as Mai- monides conceived of God as pure intellect; it followed that the only way to approach the divine was by cultivating one\u2019s intellect at the expense of other aspects of the human psyche. These tendencies were to some degree balanced and corrected by the flourishing of the Kabbalah, but the full return of the personal, passionate God of the Bible, Talmud, and Midrash awaited the Ha- sidic movement in the eighteenth century. Hasidism promoted devekut\u2014 \u201ccommunion with God\u201d\u2014as a central religious value. In some Hasidic circles devekut was understood as loss of ego, the individual self merging with the Absolute. But alongside this tendency there was also a personalistic under- standing of God, who bore close resemblance to the deity of Tanakh and clas- sic Aggadah, and who could be approached by the individual hasid in prayer and other modes of devoted relationship. In the tales and folk traditions of the movement, the mode of dialogic intimacy held a far more prominent place than that of acosmism and merging with the Absolute, but it must be under- stood that part of the genius of Hasidism is that the two approaches were seen to complement rather than conflict with each other.",h.a.createElement("br",null),h.a.createElement("br",null)),h.a.createElement("div",{className:"PDFBody"},"Alongside devekut, another keyword in Hasidism is hitkashrut\u2014\u201cbonding.\u201d What devekut describes for the hasid in relation to God, hitkashrut portrays for the relationship between the hasid and the master, known as the rebbe or zad-",h.a.createElement("br",null),h.a.createElement("br",null)),h.a.createElement("div",{className:"PDFBody"},"dik.

The story of the growth and spread of Hasidism throughout Eastern Europe has been told elsewhere; our concern here is to suggest that for all the com- plexity and diversity of Hasidic spirituality, the inner life of the movement might be grasped by focusing on the two themes of devekut and hitkashrut: bonding to God, to the rebbe, and the community of fellow hasidim.

The appearance of Immanuel Etkes\u2019s The Besht: Magician, Mystic, and Leader is thus a cause for celebration, for Etkes, a highly regarded Israeli historian, has produced a study of the Baal Shem Tov which is methodologically sound, firmly grounded on historical evidence, and\u2014 most importantly\u2014succeeds in bringing the personality of this mystical leader to life.",h.a.createElement("br",null),h.a.createElement("br",null)),h.a.createElement("div",{className:"PDFBody"},"As the title indicates, Etkes\u2019s portrait focuses on three main areas of the work of the Baal Shem Tov (often abbreviated to \u2018Besht\u2019): magician, mystic and leader. Under the first rubric, Etkes discusses the Baal Shem Tov as a practitioner of applied kabbalah, that is, an adept at theurgic use of divine Names. This is perhaps the most well-known aspect of the Besht\u2019s activities, hardly unique to Israel ben Eliezer but shared with a number of other baalei shem of this historical period. However, Etkes points to the decisive element of personal charisma in the case of the Besht. As Etkes writes, the Besht\u2019s charisma \u2018\u2018was expressed through such near-prophetic powers such as the ability to see from afar, to tell futures, to discover a soul\u2019s previous incarnations, and so forth.\u2019\u2019 (p. 78) While some of these powers may have been shared by other baalei shem, \u2018\u2018we do not know of any baal shem to whom so full a range of traits could be attributed.\u2019\u2019 (Ibid.) As a leader, the Baal Shem Tov saw himself as \u2018\u2018bearing responsibility for the Jewish people as a whole.\u2019\u2019 (p. 79) In the face of attacks from outside the Jewish community and social tensions \xdf The Author 2008.

While much of this activity involved relatively conventional leadership efforts, some of it involved heavenly intercession in the pattern of a biblical prophet. On celestial journeys, the Besht intervened to save individual souls, and attempted to avert calamities threatening the Jewish people. In these activities he meets and converses with various extraordinary figures such as the Messiah and even Satan. By his own account, the Besht\u2019s intercessory efforts were not always successful, and skeptics would naturally dismiss these episodes as pious fantasy and delusion. But the point is that the Besht believed in his own cosmic role and heavenly influence, and his disciples did as well. As Etkes shows, the image of the Baal Shem Tov as concerned and confident intercessor for Jews in both the terrestrial and supernal realms was decisive for the development of Hasidism, and nurtured the ideal of the hasidic zaddik in later generations.",h.a.createElement("br",null),h.a.createElement("br",null)),h.a.createElement("div",{className:"PDFBody"},"Etkes\u2019s depiction of the Besht as mystic is particularly strong. Placing ecstatic prayer at the center of the Besht\u2019s religious life, Etkes argues that dvekut (union with God) was an experience that permeated the Besht\u2019s outlook at all times. While ecstasy, involving involuntary shaking of the body, was by nature brief and episodic, it nevertheless colored the Besht\u2019s view of reality, since it was the experiential correlate to the doctrine of Divine immanence and the presence of God in all things. The Besht\u2019s Dvekut was an experience of intense pleasure which undergirded his robust affirmation of the world as permeated with divinity, his confident embrace of the physical, and his denial that evil had independent metaphysical reality.",h.a.createElement("br",null),h.a.createElement("br",null)),h.a.createElement("div",{className:"PDFBody"},"Not only does Etkes provide vivid portrayals of the three major domains of the Besht\u2019s functioning, he convincingly demonstrates how the three areas nurtured and reinforced each other. Because the Baal Shem Tov was a successful applied kabbalist, he had reason to travel widely, visiting many communities and meeting individuals of all stations. With an intimate knowledge of the Jewish world of his day, he was aware of the problems Jews faced and was well positioned to serve in a leadership role. Similarly, his charismatic powers gave him the self-confidence and fearlessness necessary for bold spiritual innovation. And there was a deeply emotional aspect to the Besht\u2019s personality. His feeling for common folk and identification with the suffering of his fellow Jews, individually and collectively, spurred him to utilize his charismatic powers for the benefit of his people. The recent tendency in historiography has been to downplay the narrative of crisis which earlier historians once used to help explain Hasidism\u2019s emergence. Current thinking emphasizes Polish Jewry\u2019s rather quick recovery from the Chmielnicki massacres, the robustnessReview of its economic life, and even the relative security of its political situation. While Etkes is surely aware of this trend, he reverts to the earlier approach. Thus he writes that \u2018\u2018The backdrop for the Besht\u2019s labors on behalf of the Jewish people was the bleak social and political reality of Jewish life in the eighteenth century.\u2019\u2019 This included blood- libels, Heidemak massacres, outbreaks of plague, economic upheavals, the threat of the antinomian Frankists and even the burning of the Talmud. (p. 110) Etkes\u2019s renewed foregrounding of the dangers besetting the community allows him to highlight the significance of the Besht\u2019s career, instilling hope and comfort and a sense that Jewish interests were being championed and protected by a figure of true stature and courage.",h.a.createElement("br",null),h.a.createElement("br",null)),h.a.createElement("div",{className:"PDFBody"},"In returning to the emphasis on early Hasidism as a response to crisis, Etkes\u2019s presentation must be contrasted with another important study of the Baal Shem Tov, Moshe Rosman\u2019s Founder of Hasidism: A Quest for the Historical Ba\u2019al Shem Tov. 1 Based on breakthrough work in Polish archives, Rosman asserts that the Jews of the Besht\u2019s geographic region \u2018\u2018were suffering neither mass poverty nor mass melancholia.\u2019\u2019 2 And the Baal Shem Tov was not an outsider struggling against ossified communal structures. As Rosman puts it, \u2018\u2018the Besht was much more a representative and perpetuator of existing religious, social, political, and even economic realities than he was an innovator. He certainly was no rebel against the establishment, whether religious or social.\u2019\u2019 3 Rosman is keen to show the Besht as \u2018\u2018a person of his time.\u2019\u2019",h.a.createElement("br",null),h.a.createElement("br",null)),h.a.createElement("div",{className:"PDFBody"},"While Etkes agrees with much of this, he nevertheless portrays the Besht in bolder strokes. He also has a more positive opinion of the historicity of Shivhei Habesht, a collection of hagiographic tales about the Baal Shem Tov and his circle, first published in 1814. In contrast to Rosman\u2019s skepticism, Etkes notes that details of these stories have been corroborated in external sources.

He writes, \u2018\u2018it is not the historian\u2019s business to establish whether the Besht indeed was endowed with the powers of prophecy and far-sightedness. What the historian is to do is to determine whether these abilities of the Besht played a substantial part in how he perceived himself, in how his associates viewed him, and perforce also in the relations formed between him and those who surrounded him.\u2019\u2019 (p. 223)232",h.a.createElement("br",null),h.a.createElement("br",null)),h.a.createElement("div",{className:"PDFTitle"},"Review",h.a.createElement("br",null),h.a.createElement("br",null)),h.a.createElement("div",{className:"PDFBody"},"To augment his portrait, Etkes makes use of the published homilies and sermons of the Besht\u2019s disciples, notably the writings of Rabbi Jacob Joseph of Polonne.

His willingness to use tales and teachings as well as archival materials enables Etkes to triangulate his portrayal, each source serving to enrich, complement and correct the others. What emerges is a three- dimensional, multi-hued picture of a genuine illuminate. All this leads to Etkes\u2019s conclusion that Israel ben Eliezer was indeed the founder of Hasidism, even though the rise of an organized movement took place after his death. This is because the Besht\u2019s charisma, paranormal powers, teachings on ecstatic prayer and serving God with joy were the centerpieces of the spiritual lives of his disciples such as Rabbi Dov Ber the maggid of Mezerich, Rabbi Jacob Joseph of Polonne, and other leaders of great stature. The early disciple circle cherished their master\u2019s life and teachings and lived their lives energized by the inspiration of his person, and sought to share that inspiration with others.

Before Tanya, the tzaddik was commonly understood to be an individual in whom virtue dominates over vice, whose good deeds outweigh his sins. But for Tanya, to have any sins at all consigns one to the category of rasha, wicked. To be a tzaddik, one must not only be free of sin, but free of any temptation to sin, to be so bathed in divine grace and light that one is drawn unceasingly to the good.

The category of beinoni is completely revised. No longer is the beinoni a person whose virtues and demerits are roughly in balance. Rather, the beinoni is a person who knows temptation but never succumbs to it.

Kalisker\u2019s opposition to Tanya was not a reflex reaction to the promulgation of esoterica, but a principled affirma- tion of what he saw as the essential contribution of the Hassidism of his teachers to Jewish spirituality, and which was in danger of being eroded by a theoretical systemization that paralleled the imposition of a stratified and regimented social structure.",h.a.createElement("br",null),h.a.createElement("br",null)),h.a.createElement("div",{className:"PDFBody"},"Ha-sayyif ve-ha-sefer yardu kerukhim min ha-shamayyim, \u201cthe sword and the book came down together from heaven.\u201d20 In the case of Tanya, the book was a sword; a powerful weapon that every individual hassid could wield against his own animal nature and employ to great effect in the task of moral and spiritual growth.

Of all the Jewish traditional movements and institutions in tsarist Russia and the Leninist-Stalinist onslaught that followed, Chabad Hassidism was arguably the one that stood up best to the terrors, holding ground where it seemed impossible to do so.

Be that as it may, it remains true that Tanya was the only work of Hassidic teach- ings by Rabbi Shneur Zalman published in his lifetime.

Rabbi Abraham the Angel\u2014Rabbi Shalom Shakhna\u2019s father, son of the Maggid of Mezhirech\u2014had himself died young, in the fall of 1776.

Chava would have known the Hasidim as individuals\u2014not just their personal idiosyncrasies and aspirations, but the role each Hasid played in the constellation of her late husband\u2019s community.

For her part, Chava needed her son Abraham, for, being a woman, she could not officially lead the Hasidim. As a Twersky of Chernobyl, she had had first-hand knowledge of the emerging aristocratic leadership style. But whatever her depth of experience and knowledge, only her son Abraham could be the tsaddik. Only he could avert the dissolution of the community her husband had built. In light of this convergence of interests, it is only reasonable to assume that Chava would have assisted her son in his consolidation of leadership, and she may have pointed the way from the very beginning.

In Shapiro\u2019s memoir, Sarah Devorah manages the affairs of the court and makes all major decisions. She is appropriately respectful to her son, who is after all the Rebbe, but Yerahmiel Moshe treats his mother with the greatest reverence. She is constantly chastising him for endangering his health with a grueling schedule of study and service, and with extreme asceticism. A major point of contention is the question of building a new mansion to replace the elegant home which was destroyed in a fire about six years earlier. Sarah Devorah, along with a group of loyal and generous Hasidim, conspires to go ahead with plans for new construction, but Yer- ahmiel Moshe does his best to subvert their intentions. Eventually the new house does begin to rise, due to Sarah Devorah\u2019s indefatigable marshalling of architectural, financial, and managerial resources. Speaking Polish, she works with contractors, artisans, and suppliers of raw materials, conducts labor negotiations, and deals with work stoppages and strikes. Everyone is frightened of her: she need only give one look in the direction of a group of chatting workers, and they fall silent and return to work. In addition to managing the household and court in Kozienice, she owns a country estate where the family would often spend summers. Shapiro remembers her grandmother Sarah Devorah as a woman of elegance, culture, and refinement, who prizes education and piety.

See also Assaf, Regal Way, pp. 63\u201365; 307\u2013309. But at the beginning of the nineteenth century there was ample opportunity in the form of new territory to be conquered for Hasidism. Thus, at this stage, the needs of family members to stake out their own territory dovetailed nicely with the expansionist agenda of the movement as a whole. The situation is reminiscent of the settling of New England in the roughly two centuries before 1800. The goal of every farmer was to clear enough land to set up each of his sons in an economically viable farm. Each suc- ceeding generation cleared and cultivated new areas farther away from earlier set- tlements. This process continued until they ran out of new territory, and there was no more available land to clear; see Diana Muir, Reflections in Bullough\u2019s Pond: Economy and Ecosystem in New England (Hanover, 2000). Note, for exam- ple, her remark that \u201cFor several generations . . . Massachusetts was a land of plenty. [Colonial farmers] lived well, married young if they pleased, and reared large families in the full confidence that their children would enjoy a life as com- fortable as their own. . . . [E]arly-settled towns might not have had enough space for every young couple to settle on, but there was land enough elsewhere to allow the surplus young people of each generation to pioneer farms of their own\u201d (pp. 47\u201348). One can look at the spread of Hasidic territories during the nineteenth century in a similar way, as being largely driven by the ongoing branching of dynastic trees, as successive generations of sons and sons-in-law of famous tsad- dikim were motivated to find new towns in which to establish a rebistve.",h.a.createElement("br",null),h.a.createElement("br",null)),h.a.createElement("div",{className:"PDFBodyFN"},"31.

Perl also mentions another yenuka, \u201cPinchsel Sohn des Rebi Srul Abraham.\u201d The editor of Uiber das Wesen der Sekte Chassidim says that he was unable to identify this person, but Perl was evidently referring to Rabbi Pinhas Shapiro of Cherny Ostrov, a grandson of the famed Rabbi Zusia of Hannipol. Pinhas\u2019s father, Rabbi Israel Abraham (1772\u20131814) was the publisher of No\u2019am Elimelekh by his uncle Rabbi Elimelekh of Lyzhansk (Yitzhak Alfasi, Ha- Hasidut mi-Dor le-Dor (Jerusalem, 1995), Vol. 1, p. 149). Alfasi states that after Rabbi Israel Abraham\u2019s death in 1814, \u201chis widow conducted herself as a Rebbe,\u201d and also offers the information that in 1834 she emigrated to the Holy Land and was killed in the earthquake of 1837 (ibid.).

It is a scholarly commonplace that Hasidic hagiography must be used with great caution as a historical source. Nevertheless, a number of highly regarded studies do rely on this genre, at least to some degree. See for example Arthur Green\u2019s Tormented Master, which draws extensively on the Bratslav literature on Rabbi Nahman. For Green\u2019s discussion of the methodological issues, see pp. 6\u201314. Immanuel Etkes makes extensive use of the first Hasidic hagiographical collec- tion, Shivhei ha-Besht, for his study of the Baal Shem Tov in Ba\u2019al Hashem: The Besht\u2014Magic, Mysticism, Leadership (Jerusalem, 2000), pp. 217\u2013265. In contrast to other scholars who treat Shivhei ha-Besht with great suspicion, Etkes, in a lengthy excursus on Shivhei ha-Besht as a historical source, concludes that \u201ca significant proportion of the stories brought in this collection can be categorized as testi- monies and reliable traditions anchored in the personal experiences of the Besht and his circle\u201d (p. 265). The entire issue is discussed by David Assaf in his biography of Rabbi Israel of Ruzhin (see above, n. 31). After noting the characteristics typical of hagiography, such as avoidance of problematic topics, apologetic intent, naivete, exaggerations, and imagination (Regal Way, pp. 8\u201328), Assaf nevertheless concludes that the crit- ical scholar cannot disregard this genre but must take advantage of it by \u201csepa- rat[ing] the wheat from the chaff. . . . [I]n any source that is not prima facie unacceptable, there is a core of truth grounded in factual reality\u201d (p. 26). Of spe- cial importance for our purposes is Assaf \u2019s statement that \u201cAlthough the pro- nouncements attributed to Rabbi Israel and stories about him were published many years after his death, it is assumed as a rule that the material is basically authentic, although perhaps not as actually worded\u201d (23). Assaf and others have pointed out examples where specific hagiographic asser- tions have received surprising confirmation in newly discovered historical materi- als. It now seems clear that the very reason that Hasidic hagiographic writing is often so tendentious\u2014namely, the deep esteem and reverence of the writer for the tsaddik\u2014is precisely the impetus for collecting and preserving traditions about the master with great care and zeal. In this paper we will assume that the stories about the Ruzhiner and his family are in large measure genuine traditions transmitted orally or in writing, sometimes for several generations, but that their mode of pre- sentation and contextualization may reflect the interests and perspective of the final editor or anthologist. It is therefore appropriate and necessary to read with attention to anomalies, silences, gaps, and suppressed voices. See above, note 32. Most important for our purposes is that the editor of the collections from which we will quote often provides a named source for his stories. As Etkes and others have noted, this type of attribution is generally quite reliable; it is not at all the case that the editor is simply making up names or an attribution chain.

Not to be confused with the Besht, this is Israel Shalom Yosef of Medzibodz (1852\u20131911), a descendent of Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel of Apta (who spent his last years in Medzibozh). Israel Shalom Yosef was a son-in-law of Rabbi Abraham Jacob of Sadgora, a child of Rabbi Israel of Ruzhin.

According to Aaron David Twersky, Sefer ha-Yahas mi-Chernobyl ve-Ruzhin (Lublin, 1938; reprinted Brooklyn, 1990), Rabbi Mordecai was already living in expansive style during his father\u2019s lifetime. During a visit to his son, Rabbi Mena- hem Nahum observed \u201cgold and silver vessels and many clocks,\u201d and asked what need there was for such things (p. 5, #3). Rabbi Mordecai is said to have replied with reference to Rabbi Judah the Patriarch, who according to the Talmud was surrounded by abundance yet maintained a personal asceticism (see B.T. Ketubot 104). Whatever the historicity of this family tradition, it sheds light on how Hasidism viewed the opulent lifestyle of the tsaddikim: Rabbi Judah the Patriarch is remembered as the editor of the Mishnah as well as a revered and effective communal leader who related to Roman rulers on equal terms; he embodied \u201cTorah and worldly grandeur in one place.\u201d It should also not be overlooked that Davidic descent was claimed for Rabbi Judah the Patriarch. Twersky also states that Rabbi Mordecai of Chernobyl\u2019s tenure as tsaddik lasted \u201cabout fifty years\u201d (p. 102, #1). If correct, this suggests that not only Rabbi Mordecai\u2019s lifestyle but his aristocratic court system may have originated during his father\u2019s lifetime. Rabbi Mordecai died in 1838; fifty years earlier brings us back to 1788, almost ten years before Rabbi Menahem Nahum\u2019s death in 1797 (see Arthur Green, Menahem Nahum of Chernobyl, pp. 24\u201325). Other sources, how- ever, say that Rabbi Mordecai led his community for about forty years; this would place the beginning of his tenure about the time of his father\u2019s death.

Immanuel Etkes has described the attempt of Rabbi Menahem Mendel of Vitebsk and Rabbi Abraham of Kalisk to lead White Russian Hasidism from Eretz Israel in the 1780s.

In recent years we have the example of Hasidic communities after the Holo- caust. Almost without exception, it was only where a scion of the dynasty sur- vived the war that the community was able to reconstitute itself, generally in Israel or America.

A version of this story is found in Kerem Yisrael, which states that the meeting took place in Prohobitch at the time when Rabbi Shneur Zalman \u201cwas returning from [St.] Petersburg,\u201d presumably after his release from prison in 1801 (p. 58, #4). But if he was returning home to White Russia after his ordeal in St. Petersburg, he would hardly have gone by way of Prohobitz, roughly 1000 miles to the south.

In an effort to appeal to a broad cross-section of the Jewish com- munity, and to forestall defections, many synagogues adopt a stance which cuts across the neat ideological divisions fostered by the major branches of American Judaism and their respective theological seminaries. We thus hear of Orthodox synagogues "leaning to" Conservative, Reconstructionist "leaning to" Reform, and similar postural permutations. In a quiet Boston suburb, situated just outside the high-technology belt traced by Route 128, a young rabbinic graduate of Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati named Lawrence Kushner is apparently evolving a new religious orientation, which might be called Reform-leaning-to-neo-Hasidic. Congregation Beth El, of which he is the rabbi, delights in resurrecting archaic traditions and rituals. Congregants sway and chant in the traditional manner, Hasidic melodies punctuate the service, and large woolen tallitat (prayer shawls) are de riguer. The quiet decorum which characterized the classical Reform service is conspicuously absent. Yet this is no Hasidic shtibel: women may lead services, and the congregation recently published its own nonsexist prayerbook. The general tone is informal and participatory; a conscious effort is made to lessen the physical and psychological distance between rabbi and congregant. Kushner has several books to his credit. Unlike standard rabbinic literary productions \u2014 warmed-over sermons and moralistic and inspirational tracts \u2014 Kushner has attempted to write seforim, sacred texts meant to be studied and not just read, in the English language. His first book, The Book of Letters, combined calligraphy and text in an evocative presentation of the rabbinic and kabbalistic traditions regarding the mystery and power of the Hebrew language and its constituent elements. In his second work, Honey from the Rock: Vision of Jewish Mystical Renewal, Kushner presented a contemporary articulation of the kabbalistic system of Sefirot.',h.a.createElement("br",null),h.a.createElement("br",null)),h.a.createElement("div",{className:"PDFBody"},"His latest work, The River of Light: Spirituality, Judaism, and the Evolution of Consciousness (Rossel Books, $12.95 hardcover; Harper & Row, $8.95 paperback), marks a new stage in Kushner's development as a religious thinker and writer. It is his boldest and most ambitious book to date, distinguished for breadth of vision and elegance of expression.

Rather than stating his thesis \u2014 that a mystical unity obtains between the deepest core of the human psyche, the universe and God \u2014 in a didactic manner, Kushner allows his point to emerge gradually from the complexly textured patterns of the work itself.

Judg- ed on the basis of stylistic criteria, it successfully captures the spirit of rabbinic The Christian CENTURYMidrash in a contemporary idiom. In exploring the parallels between the dynamics of biblical narrative and the dream state, Kushner convincingly demonstrates the close relationship between the Jewish exegetical tradition and the techniques of psychoanalytic interpretation. While many others have written about "Freud and Judaism" using the methods of intellectual history, he relies on a type of phenomenological evocation which is particularly appropriate for his subject. Kushner charts new territory for Jewish theology in his treatment of the relationship between certain findings at the cutting edges of contemporary science, such as molecular biology and astrophysics, and the teachings of Jewish mysticism. Before we are able properly to evaluate Kushner\'s contribution, however, we must take a brief look at the history of the uneasy interaction between modern science and Jewish thought.',h.a.createElement("br",null),h.a.createElement("br",null)),h.a.createElement("div",{className:"PDFBody"},'We are all familiar with the story of the clash between Galileo and the Roman Catholic Church.

It is important to point out, however, that in the medieval period and beyond, the Jewish community had far less rigid governance procedures and ecclesiastical structures than did the Catholics. And before we assume that Judaism in this period was more open to new ideas and more tolerant of divergent opinions, we must recall that Jewish religious authorities simply did not have the ability to enforce total conformity. While it is true that, as Andre Neher has pointed out, the Midrashic tradition of exegetical freedom allowed for a nonliteral reading of biblical texts which were cited as proof of a geocentric universe, nevertheless Jewish proponents of the heliocentric world view were often severely criticized.

To this day, much of the research and publishing activity of the Association of Orthodox Jewish Scientists relates to what, in Christian circles, is called creationist science.

The verities of the classical period have been irrevocably shattered. There has been a revolutionary shift in the way we look at both macrocosmic and microcosmic events. This relates in part to the discovery of new facts previously unknown; but more significantly, there is a new understanding of what scientific "facts" are, and how they are shaped by the physical and conceptual tools of the investigator. There is a new apprehension of scientific knowledge as being socially constructed, and therefore not objective in quite the same way as had once been assumed. There is an emerging realization that the adoption of new scientific theories may sometimes have as much to do with techniques of persuasion as with supposedly incontrovertible evidence or the results of "crucial" experiments.',h.a.createElement("br",null),h.a.createElement("br",null)),h.a.createElement("div",{className:"PDFBody"},'In physics, the shattered fragments of the once-indestructible atom have long since been transferred to an elementary particle "zoo" of bewildering diversity.

Berkeley noted caustically that anyone who could "digest a second or third fluxion, a second or third difference, need not . . . be squeamish about any point in Divinity." That Berkeley*s attack was not merely a case of gratuitous carping or sour grapes is demonstrated by the fact that the placing of the calculus on a sound methodological footing engaged some of the greatest mathematical thinkers \u2014 of the stature of Gauss, Cauchy, Weierstrass and others \u2014 well into the 19th century.',h.a.createElement("br",null),h.a.createElement("br",null)),h.a.createElement("div",{className:"PDFBody"},'If Berkeley were alive today, he would undoubtedly point out that anyone who could digest the Uncertainty Principle, the particle-wave duality, the theory of relativity, and the embarrassing abundance of real and virtual elementary particles "need not be squeamish about any point in Divinity."

He avoids an excessive obeisance to the truth claims of the scientific world view, and resists the understandable temptation to use the new discoveries as a whetstone to sharpen his own doctrinal axe. For example, he notes the remarkable parallel between the recently discovered background microwave radiation, thought to be a residue of the cosmic "Big Bang," and the "hidden light" of the first moments of creation spoken of by the Midrash and Zohar. He does not use this point, however, to feed a sense of triumphalism that "we knew it all along." Rather, he suggests that the correspondences between the emerging scientific mythology and ancient religious truth should not surprise us because both reflect an essential connection between the universe, the Divine, and human consciousness.',h.a.createElement("br",null),h.a.createElement("br",null)),h.a.createElement("div",{className:"PDFBody"},'As the eminent physicist John Archibald Wheeler put it in a statement cited by Kushner, "The analysis of the physical world, pursued to sufficient depth, will lead back in some now-hidden way to man himself, to conscious mind, tied unexpectedly through the very acts of observation and participation to partnership in the foundation of the universe." One could hardly imagine a better contemporary Midrash on the verse, "And God created man in His own image . . ." But what kind of God are we now talking about? What, in particular, of the God of the biblical and rabbinic tradition who rewards, punishes, redeems, commands and reveals himself in moments of transcendent majesty? Kushner reminds u#fat this point of the teachings of Jewish mysticism which place God as much within us as in heaven, which affirm divine immanence as much as divine transcendence. There is no need, says Kushner, to choose between these two views of God; both are true in their own way: The One of Being did not speak from without or from within, but from without and from within. . . . Our goal must be to restore the balance, to place the source of the voice, the source of reality, everywhere. Inside us and outside us. The "I am the One of Being" which one tradition heard from on top of the mountain, could also have been heard from within every person. . . .

Generally, however, there was a quick return to less controversial theological formulations. In the case of Hasidism, which is most instructive in this regard, the backing-off was undoubtedly due in part to the vehemence of the opposition which the theological radicalism engendered. But it would be a mistake to suppose that the threats, denunciations and bans of excommunication issued by their opponents (called the Mitnaggedim) against the Hasidim were very effective in stemming the spread of the new revivalist movement. They were npt.

If God has given us a Torah, and a world in which to fulfill it, God evidently did not want us to short-circuit the pathway to the divine perspective on reality, to the vision of undifferentiated Unity.

The author himself points to the problem; toward the end of the book he warns the reader: "If the searcher chooses to remain with eternity, the searcher loses eternity! If the searcher chooses this finite world, the searcher is rewarded with eternity!" Yes, but what does it now mean to "choose this finite world"? The reader is presented with profound insights, but with little sense of how they can be integrated into his or her daily life in any concrete way. Once again, a glance at the history of Jewish mysticism is instructive. At the same time that the Kabbalah spoke of the Divine within, of the Primordial Adam in whose matrix we are formed, of the return back to Nothing, there was always an emphasis on praxis, on the necessity to follow a spiritual path full of effort and self-discipline. The work was arduous and involved an element of self-surrender. To have presented a vision of ultimate mystical reality without at the same time demanding from the devotee a total commitment and rigorous training would probably have struck the great Jewish mystics as being dangerous, frivolous or both.',h.a.createElement("br",null),h.a.createElement("br",null)),h.a.createElement("div",{className:"PDFBody"},'In its substitution of vicarious experience for the total personal involvement demanded by most spiritual disciplines, The River of Light is not really so far from American suburban culture as its author might suppose. Exploring the bed of Kushner\'s "river," one dredges up sedimentary layers deposited by successive cultural waves: the human potential movement, Jungian thought and transpersonal psychology, along with traces of Eastern mysticism (California vintage). With respect to Jewish practice in particular, Kushner in effect wishes to have his kuchel and eat it too: he would like to embrace only those elements of Jewish observance which seem appropriate to a postrationalist, quasi-mystical suburban culture, while rejecting the rest.
