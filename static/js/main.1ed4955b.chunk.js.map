Katz has argued that “[t]he\n        role of scripture . . . is essential to the major mystical traditions and to the teachings and\n        experiences of their leading representatives.”<span className=\"SuperScript\">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\n        Professor Katz surveys the varied forms of\n        mystical scriptural interpretation across esoteric traditions, making ample use of the\n        Jewish mystical tradition, especially Zohar. This essay continues his work with a focus\n        on hasidic scriptural exegetical texts, the derashot. I will argue that Hasidic derashot\n        exemplify active interpretation, and the intimate personal engagement of the inter-\n        preter. While mystical receptivity is indeed cultivated, there is also active intervention\n        and deliberate recontextualization. The charismatic hasidic interpreter embraces\n        sacred scripture in a dynamic personal relationship, with the belief that the recontextu-\n        alizing and renewed understanding of verses changes reality itself, moving all in the\n        direction of compassion and beneficence. This interpretive posture of personal rela-\n        tionship is grounded in a robust individualism that differs from the quest for Ayin, the\n        Nothing or Absolute, that has often been emphasized by many scholars of Hasidism.\n        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n        Israel ben Eliezer (d. 1760), known as the Baal Shem Tov and considered by\n        devotees as the founder of Hasidism, taught that every word of Torah can sustain\n        two opposing interpretations, one pointing in the direction of severity,\n        and one pointing toward compassion, or the notion that “the righteous transform\n        the sense of severity to that of compassion.”\n        <span className=\"SuperScript\">2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;   For the Baal Shem Tov, the\n        spiritual integrity of the interpreter is more important than intellectual skill\n        or knowledge of the canon. When one learns Torah from a teacher of proper\n        spirit, then the teaching “is fruitful and multiplies”;\n        <span className=\"SuperScript\">3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;  that is, the wisdom is alive\n        and robust, reverberating and sparkling with implications, repercussions, and\n        transformative power. On the other hand, “When one learns from a wicked\n        person, then [even though the message may be correct] it is not fruitful and\n        does not multiply, but remains flat, just as the student learned it.”<span className=\"SuperScript\">4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\n        In a companion teaching, the Baal Shem Tov argues a complementary point:\n        The Torah’s many commandments (613 according to talmudic tradition) can\n        all be distilled to the Ten Commandments, and these in turn are rooted in just\n        one word, the Anokhi, the “I am” that opens the Decalogue. This process is\n        one of unification, of finding the source of the many in the one, and can only\n        take place when “the soul of one’s teacher is rooted in the World of Unity; but\n        when the teacher’s soul is in the world of Division, then the disciple receives\n        teachings that are separate, isolated.”<span className=\"SuperScript\">5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;   This approach to interpretation eschews\n        judgments of true/false in favor of fertile/sterile; similarly, teachers are not\n        ranked according to mental agility or analytic refinement but by their ability\n        to instill awareness of an underlying unity in disparate materials and eventu-\n        ally to unity in life perspective. For the Baal Shem Tov, because every word of\n        Torah can be taken positively or negatively, the true teacher is responsible for\n        bringing the words to the side of good and blessing, comprehending the text\n        in the most beneficent way. The active interpreter’s understanding shapes the\n        text, transforming the world itself.<span className=\"SuperScript\">6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\n        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n        Prominent third generation master, Rabbi Elimelekh of Lyzhensk (Lezajsk;\n        1717–1787), highlights the activist understanding of Torah interpretation in\n        Noam Elimelekh: “When a zaddik wishes to exert influence and alter circum-\n        stances (in the direction of beneficence), he must attire the desired change in\n        the garb of Torah. The Torah raises the matter, presenting it before God . . . By\n        means of the Torah, the person can express his desire and make things happen\n        in accord with his will.”<span className=\"SuperScript\">7</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Elimelekh defines a hasidic reading as an expression\n        of the tzaddik’s active, beneficent desire to channel blessing via the Torah. The\n        universal, comprehensive, determinative nature of Torah means that one can\n        always find a way to express whatever one needs and wants to express, with the\n        assurance that this articulation will lead to the desired result. Beginning with\n        the Baal Shem Tov, then, hasidic interpreters have intentionally responded to\n        what they perceive as a mandate to express meaning that conveys blessed, joyous possibility.\n        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n        One of the most striking articulations of the activist, interventionist mode\n        of interpretation is found in the work of Rabbi Yaakov Leiner (1828–1878), the\n        second master in the lineage of Izbica-Radzyn. Rabbi Leiner’s teaching appears\n        as a comment on Jacob’s dying plea to his son Joseph: “If now I have found\n        favor (hen) in your eyes . . . deal kindly and truly with me, and please don’t bury\n        me in Egypt.”<span className=\"SuperScript\">8</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Rabbi Leiner asks, “Did not Jacob trust Joseph to fulfill his dying\n        request—from a father to a son—to be buried in Canaan, without invoking\n        ‘grace’ or ‘favor’?”\n        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n        He answers:\n        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n        There are places in Torah which on the surface appear uninspiring. To the\n        person who just sees their surface meaning, they appear as a lifeless,\n        immobile body. Such a lackluster appearance is akin to being buried.\n        However, for someone who sees the words of Torah in a gracious, favorable light, there is no passage in Torah that is uninspiring, for by means of\n        the gracious regard (hen) he has for Torah, his heart is aligned with and\n        resonates with the depth of these seemingly buried passages.<span className=\"SuperScript\">9</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\n        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n        In this teaching, Rabbi Leiner sets up a correspondence between Joseph’s\n        willingness to transfer his father’s body from Egypt to Canaan and gracious\n        readings of biblical texts. From a superficial perspective, it should make no\n        difference where a body is buried. After all, the dead can be regarded as so\n        much dust, and it should not matter whether the body is placed in one location or another. It is grace—that is, the desire to persist in cherishing ongoing\n        relationship grounded in shared memory and future hope—that motivates\n        and energizes the project of transferring a body to a preferred location. As\n        Jon Levenson explains regarding Jacob’s elicitation of Joseph’s promise,\n        “he . . . makes Joseph promise to bury him in the promised land, thus reiterating and deepening familial devotion to the patrimony of which they have yet\n        to take possession.”<span className=\"SuperScript\">10</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;   That is, the location of Jacob’s body is indeed significant,\n        as it serves to focus the family’s geographical attention and emotional devotion\n        elsewhere than Egypt, to the location of its past and its future in Canaan.\n        Rabbi Leiner draws out the implications for exegesis as follows: there are\n        some sections of Torah that seem dead, that do not arouse interest and appear\n        devoid of spiritual meaning. Only a gracious reading reframes, re-deposits,\n        spatially translates, re-contextualizes, and restores life to such passages. This\n        is a remarkable acknowledgement that there are passages of which one might\n        be tempted to merely say, ‘Give them a decent burial.’ Gracious reading opens\n        the heart to meaning, bringing frozen passages to warmth and life. One can\n        see the whole Izbica project as a sustained and determined act of gracious\n        reframing, re-reading of the Torah in its entirety, especially the narrative sec-\n        tions that on the surface appear awkward and less than inspiring.<span className=\"SuperScript\">11</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Izbica\n        knows where the bodies are buried, and it is not shy about pointing them out,\n        digging to reposition them so they may speak with renewed life.\n        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n        Another major hasidic lineage of Poland is that of Ger (Gora Kalwaria), in\n        whose work we find a similar idea. Rabbi Yehudah Aryeh Leib Alter comments\n        on Gen. 28:11, which describes the fugitive Jacob’s “assembling the stones of\n        the place” around his head.<span className=\"SuperScript\">12</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;   According to Rabbi Alter, this means that out\n        of the fragments of his dislocated life, Jacob arranged an edifice of meaning,\n        a coherent conceptual structure, a “Torah of the place.”<span className=\"SuperScript\">13</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\n        Similarly, each generation is bidden to take the particularities of its own place and time, its own\n        existential circumstance, and shape them into Torah.<span className=\"SuperScript\">14</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Drawing on an old mystical motif from Sefer Yetzirah that refers to the letters of the Hebrew alphabet\n        as stones, and letter permutations as rearranged stones, Rabbi Alter asserts\n        that there are some scriptural passages whose meaning is clear, direct, and\n        that speak with transparent power; there are other passages whose meaning\n        is murky and that call for mindful attention. As the Talmud acknowledges, in\n        order to make an exegetical derivation work, elements of the text may need to\n        be rearranged.<span className=\"SuperScript\">15</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;   This is an activist, interventionist construction of meaning.<span className=\"SuperScript\">16</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n        Another aspect of hasidic exegesis might be called a theology of intimate\n        perception of the textual surface. Rabbi Moshe Hayyim Efraim of Sudylkow\n        (c. 1748–1800), grandson of the Baal Shem Tov, wrote a work called Degel\n        Mahaneh Efraim that transmits many traditions from the author’s celebrated\n        grandfather. In a discussion of the manna, Rabbi Moshe Hayyim Efraim draws\n        an analogy between the “food from heaven” that the Israelites gathered during their wilderness trek, and the task of the interpreter of Torah. His point\n        of departure is the following verse “This is the food that God has given you\n        for eating . . . gather from it, each person (ish) according to what he eats—\n        according to the number of your people, every person (ish) according to whom-\n        ever is in his tent shall you take.”<span className=\"SuperScript\">17</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Rabbi Moshe Hayyim Efraim presents a\n        parable from his grandfather the Baal Shem Tov, followed by his interpretation.\n        While in general the expositions in Degel Mahaneh Efraim are reasonably clear\n        as hasidic texts go, this piece is elusive and cryptic, apparently deliberately\n        so. The text—both the grandfather’s parable and grandson’s application—is\n        presented below in its entirety. While the body of my response to the teaching\n        is placed at the conclusion, from time to time I make insertions, marked by\n        square brackets, where I feel that interstitial phrases are necessary for understanding. Biblical quotes are set in small caps to assist the reader in seeing\n        how the rabbi is nuancing the verse. Finally, I break up the text into paragraphs not present in the original Hebrew, and assign letters to the paragraphs.\n        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n        He writes:\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n        (A) In my humble opinion this verse [Ex. 16:16] contains a counsel/secret\n        [sod] of the Lord for those that fear Him [cf.

Nahmanides, in his commentary on the Torah, employs the phrase\n        “by way of truth,” al derekh ha-emet, to introduce a kabbalistic interpretation,<span className=\"SuperScript\">18</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\n        but it is likely that the author’s primary intention here is more general. He is\n        sharing his confidence that what he is about to present is truthful, an accurate assessment of the verse’s inner meaning and, more broadly, of the manna\n        motif in scripture. Section (B) introduces the stress on the keyword ‘ish,’ or\n        person, which appears twice in Ex. 16:16, and motivates the entire piece’s\n        focus on personhood and individuality. It sets the stage for introducing the\n        Baal Shem Tov’s parable. Section (C), the parable, will be discussed at length\n        below, but at this point it is important to note that the king has multiple\n        children, each one with a special virtue; no single child is singled out for unique\n        superiority.<span className=\"SuperScript\">19</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\n        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n        In section (D) the author alludes to a Zohar passage <span className=\"SuperScript\">20</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;which adduces\n        various terms for humans, such as ish (human being), gever (man), enosh\n        (mortal), and asserts that “the greatest of them all is adam.” As demonstrated\n        by Gen. 1:27 and 9:6, Adam was made in the image of God. The human task\n        is to move oneself to ever-higher levels of being, eventually rising to become\n        the true Adam, the divine image. Thus the ‘ish’ of Ex. 16:16 is invited to find the\n        manna and savor the taste specifically meant for that person. Absorption and\n        integration of that nourishment enables the person to rise to the level of the\n        quintessential human, Adam. All this is understood as taking place along two\n        linked dimensions: the Israelites’ physical eating of the manna in the Exodus\n        narrative, and the interpreter’s attunement to the peculiarities of the text’s surface features, unlocking and accessing its deeper message.\n        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n        The Hebrew word for taste, ta’am, occurs with reference to the manna at\n        Ex. 16:31 (“and its taste was like wafers in honey”) as well as at Num. 11:8 (“and\n        its taste was as the taste of a cake baked in oil”), giving rise to the midrashic\n        tradition that the Israelites could taste whatever they desired in the manna.\n        ‘Taste’ as signifying spiritual experience is already found in the Bible in\n        Psalm 34:9, “Taste and see how good the Lord is.” In the medieval period, Judah\n        Ha-Levi’s Kuzari invokes taste repeatedly to convey his phenomenology of\n        religious experience in contrast to the logical arguments of Jewish philosophy.\n        As Diana Lobel writes in her study of Sufi influence on Ha-Levi, “The sense\n        of taste is by its very nature unmediated; no second-hand report, however\n        eloquent, can convey the actual savor of a feast. Dhawq [taste] is not simply\n        a kind of cognition, but an immediate experience accompanied by relishing\n        and enjoyment.”<span className=\"SuperScript\">21</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Ha-Levi also mentions the te’amim as masoretic accents,\n        and in the following century the Zohar discusses their symbolic significance\n        as tropes, melodic modes for scriptural reading.<span className=\"SuperScript\">22</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;   All of this is background\n        for Rabbi Moshe Hayyim Efraim’s use of the term. He refers to superscripted\n        tropes, te’mamim elyonim, which are applied to notably sublime and majestic\n        passages, in particular the Decalogue. With this allusive language, the rabbi\n        of Sudylkow implies that scripture is like manna: its taste is unlocked by\n        the reader who savors its sublime possibilities. It is precisely the nobility and\n        sensitivity that one brings to a passage that frees its inner significance, allowing access and enabling it and the reader to soar together.\n        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n        In section (E) the author plays on the Hebrew root s-f-r, associated with\n        numbers, as well as with the gemstone sapphire/sapir. The multiple senses\n        of this keyword are already exploited in Sefer Yetzirah and early kabbalistic\n        texts, where sefirot are the ten divine manifestations.<span className=\"SuperScript\">23</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Here the author is not\n        thinking primarily of technical kabbalistic terminology, but the idea that the\n        individual’s soul radiates and pulsates as it recognizes affinity with surface\n        features designed for it, as these surface phenomena point to a hidden spiritual\n        treasure meant specifically for that person.\n        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n        Section (F) refers to the writings of Rabbi Jacob Joseph of Polonnoye, an\n        early disciple of the Baal Shem Tov whose works preserve the first published\n        teachings attributed to the great master.<span className=\"SuperScript\">24</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The specific passage is found in\n        Tzafnat Pa’ane’ah, originally published in 1782.<span className=\"SuperScript\">25</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;   This passage details the rabbinic doctrine of resurrection of the dead as well as the biblical prooftexts that\n        the Talmud supplies to anchor this doctrine in scripture. Rabbi Jacob Joseph\n        of Polonnoye recounts that a certain group of medieval Jews challenged the\n        rabbinic readings, pointing out that the verses in question could be read\n        differently and that the prooftexts were hardly dispositive. The reply is that the\n        yearning for a spiritual state reflects a predisposition for it, an intuitive, tacit\n        comprehension that makes the idea congenial. Those individuals who find\n        rabbinic prooftexts for resurrection unpersuasive indeed have no affinity with\n        that state, which implies that they are not destined for resurrection.\n        In Section (G) the rabbi understands the “tent” of Ps. 78:60 in the mystic sense of a nimbus that envelops the individual, known in Kabbalah as\n        “surrounding presence” (maqqif ).<span className=\"SuperScript\">26</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Each individual is invited to take and taste\n        what is truly theirs by deep affinity so that they may become Adam as in Psalm\n        78:60, “ohel shiken ba-adam”—“the tent he had set among men” or, as the rabbi\n        suggests we read the verse, “the tent he had set around Adam.” The “tent” or\n        maqqif, that is, the envelope encasing one’s personhood, is illumined by affinity with the scriptural passage that speaks most directly to it.<span className=\"SuperScript\">27</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\n        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n        Rabbi Moshe Hayyim Efraim’s conclusion in Section H is moving and poignant. He argues that the parable itself belongs to whoever understands it,\n        shines, and resonates with it, whoever discerns and savors both its surface\n        and depth more richly. Indeed, the parable has implications that perhaps even\n        Rabbi Moshe Hayyim Efraim has not fully grasped. There are always levels that\n        only the future will reveal. And the inheritors of the parable may be disciples,\n        not necessarily the rabbi’s biological heirs. This point has implications in light\n        of hasidic history, which at this time was already moving to a dynastic system\n        largely based on filial succession.<span className=\"SuperScript\">28</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The rabbi suggests that the legacy of spirit\n        is not limited to any one family tree, and true kinship with scripture’s riches are\n        open to whoever perceives them. This is a striking statement coming from the\n        grandson of the founder of Hasidism.\n\n\n        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBodyTitle\">\n        Discussion\n        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n        While the use of parables in early Hasidism is well known, this particular parable has not received sustained attention.<span className=\"SuperScript\">29</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;   It is reminiscent of other early\n        hasidic parables that feature kings, princes, servants, and treasures. Typically,\n        the servants are distracted by gold and silver and only the son remains faithful\n        to the real quest and perseveres to find the treasure, the King Himself. In an\n        extended essay, Moshe Idel has discussed the famous “Parable of the Son of\n        the King and the Imaginary Walls,” often understood as reflecting a pantheistic\n        or acosmistic theology, but which Idel sees as expressing a personal relationship between king and son. As he writes, in that parable “no full pantheism is\n        assumed, despite the resort to the concept of illusion. There is a center from\n        which the light radiates and this center is described in strongly anthropomorphic terms: the face of the king.”<span className=\"SuperScript\">30</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; And, as Idel suggests, in that parable the\n        prince confirms his true relationship with the king by overcoming enemies\n        and collapsing any supposed distance between son and father. In our parable\n        however, there is not just one true son or one correct interpretation. Rather,\n        “kol ehad yesh lo ma’alah yeterah zeh mi-zeh”: each child is blessed with a\n        faculty that the others do not share; each one’s particular gift invites awareness\n        of a specific surface feature encasing a unique treasure. The game is not zerosum; all persons in the quest can find the treasure meant for them and add to\n        the rich palette of Torah interpretation.<span className=\"SuperScript\">31</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n        Mystical readers tend to look for secrets under the surface of sacred text.\n        But we have here a theology of the textual surface, a heightened attentiveness\n        to exterior aspects that are not perceived as arbitrary, capricious, or misleading. What appears to be scaffolding actually supports a deeper message that\n        leads reciprocally to a more powerful appreciation of the surface itself. This\n        appreciation is rooted in an epistemology of faith: one must have faith that\n        superficial perception actually conforms to deeper phenomena, and one must\n        recognize that the surface pattern indicates resonant affinity. When one identifies the surface feature corresponding to the treasure, the soul shines, glow-\n        ing with the excitement of discovery and the characteristic frequency of the\n        treasure itself.\n        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n        The biblical motif of manna is a perfect vehicle for this teaching: the manna’s\n        taste was appealing because the savor is a genuine sign of divine favor and\n        presence. Already in Psalms, manna is described as “angel food.<span className=\"SuperScript\">32</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; The connection between manna and Torah is ancient. The early midrash Mekhilta\n        de-Rabbi Ishmael tells us “only those who eat manna could interpret Torah.<span className=\"SuperScript\">33</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; And\n        Shemot Rabbah, a later aggadic midrash, links the revelatory Voice of Sinai—\n        which was heard by all recipients according to their absorptive capacity— with\n        the manna, whose taste and tactile sensation was tailored to each Israelite in\n        an age-appropriate manner.<span className=\"SuperScript\">34</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\n        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n        Thus Rabbi Moshe Hayyim Efraim draws on a well-established tradition\n        linking manna and Torah, but he extends and develops it with his self-reflective examination of the process of exegesis, which he says depends on intuiting\n        connections between seemingly arbitrary features on the surface and hidden\n        riches below. This points to something often missed about ParDeS, the four-faceted system of interpretation from the Middle Ages.<span className=\"SuperScript\">35</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; What may have been\n        tacitly understood by many kabbalists and what the hasidic master now makes\n        explicit is that the four levels dovetail, buttressed and undergirded by the belief\n        in scripture as an organic, integrated whole. Kabbalistic and hasidic readings\n        are symbolic, to be sure, but the symbols are not adventitiously chosen or haphazardly deployed. Surface texture and deep significance project onto each\n        other reciprocally because all layers are encased in a relational latticework that\n        is intuited by the reader for whom the pattern is organically consistent.\n        More broadly, the Baal Shem Tov’s parable and Rabbi Moshe Hayyim\n        Efraim’s application of it may be seen as an effort to preempt a critique of\n        hasidic exegesis. Already in the rabbinic period, as Christine Hayes has shown,\n        the Babylonian amoraim “felt a deep ambivalence about non-contextual or\n        midrashic methods of exegesis.”<span className=\"SuperScript\">36</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; This anxiety about midrashic exegesis left\n        its traces in discussions of peshat versus derash in the medieval period, and\n        may have been felt with particular acuity by hasidic masters, whose techniques were perceived by some to be especially idiosyncratic and eccentric.\n        The skepticism about hasidic exegesis carries forward into the modern period.\n        Louis Jacobs, a twentieth-century rabbinic scholar basically sympathetic to\n        Hasidism wrote the following: “Hasidic ‘Torah’ can hardly be described as exegesis. The texts are taken\n        completely out of context to yield the desired conclusions; ideas are read into the texts that by no stretch of the imagination can\n        they possibly mean; grammar and syntax are completely ignored; there is not\n        the slightest indication of any awareness of the historical background.”<span className=\"SuperScript\">37</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; As if\n        in response to the implied critique of hasidic readings, Rabbi Moshe Hayyim\n        Efraim asserts that they speak to those for whom their message is addressed.\n        This approach is obviously circular, but the rabbi would no doubt see this as\n        a virtuous circularity: persons comprehend surface features whose depth they\n        already intuit, whose message in some sense they already own.<span className=\"SuperScript\">38</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\n        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n        The Centrality of Personhood\n        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n        Scholarship on hasidism has tended to focus on mystical states and the relationship of yesh [being] and ayin [naught], to the relative neglect of the individual\n        personality. But the interpretive dynamics of early hasidism depend crucially\n        on the personhood of the interpreter engaging with the personality of Torah,\n        effectively identical with the personality of God. The hasidic interpreter not\n        only applies a method, but also explores and reveals the personal aspect of self\n        and of Torah, in dialogue with each other. To be sure, the mystical teachings—\n        omnipresence of God, illusory nature of evil, the creation of the world anew\n        every moment—frame and influence the teachings, but it is also true that the\n        masters celebrate the individuality of interpretation as reflecting the stamp of\n        each unique personality.\n        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n        In his work on Kabbalistic interpretation, Idel has explored the mystical\n        idea of “primordial spiritual roots and corresponding interpretations,” and is\n        careful to state that even when the infinitude of interpretations is asserted,\n        together with the belief that the soul of each Israelite holds a facet of Torah,\n        there may be “no special veneration of the uniqueness of the individual;\n        the soul is conceived of as but part of the greater spiritual reservoir of primordial\n        souls, which are no more and no less than sparks of the divine essence which\n        descended into the mundane world and will return to their supernal source\n        at the end of time.”<span className=\"SuperScript\">39</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; He does note that as the history of Kabbalah unfolds,\n        a more subjective perspective emerges, with an emphasis on the “contribution\n        of the individual” to the fullness of interpretive possibilities.<span className=\"SuperScript\">40</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; The parable of\n        the Degel Mahaneh Efraim shows that it is in Beshtian hasidism that this trend\n        flowers to its fullness. Just as Gershom Scholem has noted in regard to early\n        hasidism, that the doctrine of uplifting the sparks takes a “definite, personal,\n        and intimate turn,”<span className=\"SuperScript\">41</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; here as well, interpretation is an intimate, personal quest\n        to find what is one’s own, what truly belongs to one’s individual self and therefore to the infinitude of divine possibilities.\n        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n        All this confirms the observation of Steven T. Katz that “[E]xegesis . . . is a\n        way of learning theurgical practices that can influence God or the Ultimate;\n        a primary form, a main channel, of mystical ascent; a basic source of spiritual energy; a performative mystical act with salient experiential—transfor-\n        mational—consequences; a way of defining one’s mystical path; and a way to\n        meet and interact with God or the Ultimate(s).”<span className=\"SuperScript\">42</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Even (perhaps especially) at\n        the moment of encounter with the Absolute, the individual comes most into\n        her/his self.\n        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBodyTitle PDFBodyBiblio\">\n\n        Works Cited\n        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBodyBiblio\">\n        Alter, Yehudah Leib. “Amru Hazal she-tikken tefillat arvit,” Sefat Emet.

See his Kabbalah: New Perspectives (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1988),\n        245, where he quotes the following: “[A] person who is righteous is close to the Torah\n        and . . . the Torah is in him and he is in the Torah.” As Idel writes, “The study of Torah is\n        here regarded as a restoration of the human body through its purification, culminating\n        in a mystical union with the Torah, which dwells upon the sanctified members.” But this\n        is not the interpretive personalism of our parable. See also the discussion in Alan Brill,\n        “The Spiritual World of a Master of Awe: Divine Vitality, Theosis, and Healing in the Degel\n        Mahaneh Ephraim,” Jewish Studies Quarterly 8 (2001): 51–57, who, following Idel, correctly\n        emphasizes that for the Degel, pneumatic inspiration is the basis of Torah interpreta-\n        tion. However, he does not explore the personalist dimension. Roland Goetschel, “Torah\n        lishmah as a Central Concept in the Degel mahaneh Efrayim of Moses Hayyim Ephraim of\n        Sudylkow,” in Hasidism Reappraised, ed.

I refer to the parable Parashat Behar in Rabbi Jacob Joseph of Polonnoye\n        Toldot Ya’akov Yosef, vol. 3 (1780, reprint Monroe, NY: S. Weiss, 1998), 468–69, in which\n        the Seven Pillars of Secular Wisdom are palace treasures visible to all, hence seized by\n        ‘servants,’ while the deep treasure, understood as religious piety, is hidden by the king in\n        the palace walls. The favored son, having been alerted in advance by the king, is able to\n        notice a slight irregularity in the wall, which he proceeds to demolish, and uncovers the\n        hidden treasure. In Rabbi Jacob Joseph’s parable (which he attributes to an ambiguously\n        identified “Moharaz”), there is once again the contrast between the beloved son and the\n        servants, who evidently do not enjoy the same level of intimacy with the king. In addition,\n        the game is stacked in favor of the son, because he is told ahead of time of the existence of\n        the most precious treasure, while the servants—oblivious to the existence of any hidden\n        treasure—have no chance of finding it.Hasidic Derashah as Illuminated Exegesis\n        65\n        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBodyFN\">\n        32 \t\u0007Ps. 78:25, as understood by many ancient and modern interpreters.\n        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBodyFN\">\n        33 \t\u0007Tractate Vayissa 3; see Mekilta de-Rabbi Ishmael vol. 2, ed.

The maxim is gen-\n        erally understood to mean that only those not burdened by the cares of livelihood and\n        with sufficient leisure can devote themselves to Torah study, but it actually may refer to\n        the fact that “manna was absorbed in their bodies,” as the midrash puts it, so that the\n        ingestion of the heavenly food transformed their bodies, making them appropriate ves-\n        sels to comprehend and expound the Torah.\n        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBodyFN\">\n        34 \t\u0007Shemot Rabbah 5: 9; Cf. 25:3.\n        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBodyFN\">\n        35 \t\u0007On the four levels of scriptural meaning known as PaRDes, see Steven T.

Michael Fishbane, [Albany, NY: State University of New York Press,\n        1993], 55). He notes that the Midrash is “expressly dominated by a personalistic view of\n        God.” Ibid., 49. This means that in framing hasidic theology and exegesis, one should not\n        overemphasize metaphysical categories such as Yesh and Ayin; the personalities of God,\n        Torah, and the interpreter are always in the foreground.\n        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBodyFN\">\n        41 \t\u0007See Gershom Scholem, “Neutralization of Messianism in Early Hasidism,” in The Messianic\n        Idea in Judaism, (New York: Schocken, 1978), 188.68\n        </div>\n        </div>);\n    }\n}\n\nexport default Hasidicderashahasillumin;\n","import React from 'react';\n\nclass Yearningforsacredplacewi extends React.Component {\n    // console.log(this);\n    render()\n    {\n        return (<div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBodyTitle\">\n          Yearning for Sacred Place\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBodyTitle\">\n          Wiesel’s Hasidic Tales and Postwar Hasidism\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBodyTitle\">\n          Nehemia Polen\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBodyTitle\">\n          Prologue\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          In Souls on Fire, Elie Wiesel begins his chapter on the School of Pshiskhe with the\n          story of Eizik son of Yekel of Kraków, who dreams of treasure in Prague, but after his\n          journey discovers that the treasure is really to be found in his own home. <span className=\"SuperScript\">2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; The point\n          of the story is not, as is sometimes suggested, that since the treasure you seek is really\n          already inside of you, you don’t need to make the journey, nor even that you need to\n          make the journey in order to discover that the truth is inside you. Recall that, as Wiesel\n          writes, Rabbi Simha- Bunam of Pshiskhe would tell this story each time he accepted a\n          new disciple. <span className=\"SuperScript\">3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Rabbi Bunam did accept disciples; he did not send them all back home\n          where they came from. Apparently Rabbi Bunam wanted precisely those disciples who\n          realized that they didn’t have to be there, who knew that their spiritual growth was in\n          their own hands, not in those of the master they had sought out. The tale reflects on\n          the School of Pshiskhe, its culture and values, the independence and boldness of spirit\n          it sought to cultivate. In this understanding, the story and the journey, the tale of the\n          rabbi of Pshiskhe and his disciples, each inform the other, reflect the other, interrogate\n          the other, assist in defining the other.\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          This story on the complex interaction of rebbe, Hasid, story, and place is a good\n          point of entry for our inquiry into Wiesel’s contribution to our understanding of Ha si-\n          dism. Nearly all accounts of Hasidism point to the centrality of the zaddik in the move-\n          ment. The zaddik is link between heaven and earth, conduit of blessing, center of his\n          community, in some sense the center of the world itself. <span className=\"SuperScript\">4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; We also know of the impor-\n          tance of stories in Hasidism. From the earliest period hasidic tales conveyed the values\n          of the movement and highlighted the role of the zaddikim. Hasidic storytelling is en-\n          dowed with ritual holiness and has performative power; the telling of a story creates\n          its own sacred space. <span className=\"SuperScript\">5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; My goal here is to explore the complex relationship between zad-\n          dikim, the tales, and hasidic reconstruction of sacred place, all in light of the work and\n          contribution of Wiesel.\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBodyTitle\">\n\n          The Nineteenth Century\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n          While the zaddik and the story were central to Hasidism from its very inception, both\n          institutions continued to develop. Roughly around 1800, the zaddik’s charismatic leader-\n          ship became hereditary; among other factors, the Polish- Russian pattern of inheri-\n          tance of noble estates may have served as a model. <span className=\"SuperScript\">6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; In tandem with this development,\n          the zaddik’s place of residence took on a new importance. Throughout the nineteenth\n          century and into the twentieth, certain small and otherwise undistinguished provin-\n          cial towns— shtetlach— won fame as the home of great masters, the seat of their lin-\n          eage’s court. <span className=\"SuperScript\">7</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; This continued even after the death of the founder of the lineage, since\n          the zaddik’s residence would typically be revered as a shrine. <span className=\"SuperScript\">8</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; The belief was that the\n          spirit of the master was still present at the residence, in the court, at the grave or sep-\n          ulcher. Known as the Ohel (“Tent”), the burial place would be visited for petitionary\n          prayer and during yahrtzeits, the anniversary dates of the passing of the saintly family\n          members interred there. <span className=\"SuperScript\">9</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          Thus the rebbe’s presence made the town into a hasidic center. He became in ef-\n          fect the town’s patron, responsible for its spiritual stature and material blessing. <span className=\"SuperScript\">10</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; In-\n          deed, the town oft en owed its reputation and place on the map of the hasidic world to\n          the rebbe who bore its name. (At a still later period, as we shall see, this relationship\n          would sometimes survive the physical dislocation of the rebbe and even the destruc-\n          tion of its Jewish residents.)\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          In a parallel manner, the role of hasidic storytelling continued to evolve through-\n          out the nineteenth century. The stories of a particular lineage encapsulated the collec-\n          tive wisdom of the school where they were told and the dynasty that preserved them.\n          Tales pointed to core hasidic values as embodied in the life of the court. When the in-\n          di vidual Hasid reached a situation similar to that of the tale in some respect, he may\n          have heard in the tale the voice of his rebbe, providing inspiration and encourage-\n          ment as well as perspective and direction. The guidance received from a tale thus as-\n          sisted the Hasid to act with wisdom and integrity, consistent with the ethos and values\n          of the lineage to which he was affiliated. For example, stories in the Chabad- Lubavitch\n          school tend to emphasize Torah knowledge, Divine omnipresence, and uncompromis-\n          ing fearlessness in carrying out the will of God as understood by the rebbe. The combi-\n          nation of talmudic scholasticism, contemplation of divine immanence, and militancy\n          in praxis create the characteristic profile of Chabad Hasidism, and this signature is re-\n          flected in Chabad’s fund of stories and tales. In this way, the function of the hasidic\n          tale, the function of the court, and the function of the zaddik vis- à- vis the Hasid dove-\n          tailed and mutually reinforced each other. The rebbe told the tales and embodied their\n          wisdom, while the shtetl became the destination around which the tales turned and\n          where they would be heard most authentically and fully. Each dynasty’s storehouse of\n          hasidic tales helped define its identity in the constellation of the hasidic world. <span className=\"SuperScript\">11</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\n          Wiesel’s writings on Hasidism illustrate this interaction with poetic beauty. Listen\n          to his evocation of Worke in Somewhere a Master, in the chapter titled “The School of\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          Worke”:\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          Worke: another kingdom, a new, enchanting Hasidic adventure— another aspect of\n          hasidic language, another face of the hasidic movement.\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          Worke: a song both humble and powerful— a whisper with profound reverberations\n          of communal life, intense and intriguing alike.\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          Worke: a fervent but restrained prayer— full of ecstasy, but controlled ecstasy.\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          Worke: a journey to the end of language— to the birth of silence. <span className=\"SuperScript\">12</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\n          Note the invocation of the place- name four times, as a metonym for a style of hasidic\n          living, a culture of spirituality meticulously defined and lovingly honed. This anaphora\n          where no zaddik has yet been named identifies the hasidic culture entirely with the\n          locale, the shtetl. The chapter titles of Somewhere a Master reflect the subtle change\n          that took place as the movement matured through the nineteenth century: “Pinhas of\n          Koretz,” “Aharon of Karlin,” “Wolfe of Zbarazh,” “Barukh of Medzibozh,” “Moshe-\n          Leib of Sassov,” “The Holy Seer of Lublin,” “Meir of Premishlan,” “Naphtali of Rop-\n          shitz,” until the ninth and last chapter, “The School of Worke.” The name of each of the\n          first eight chapters is comprised of the master’s given name and the place with which he\n          was most closely associated. Both the person and the place are important, yet it seems\n          that the main emphasis is on the master, while the place- name assists in his identifica-\n          tion and is subordinate to him. But when we get to Worke (the last chronological stage\n          of this series), the place name serves as rubric for the school as a whole; the shtetl and\n          the masters who lived and taught there are now nearly identical. <span className=\"SuperScript\">13</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; This relationship be-\n          tween zaddik, place, school of hasidic culture, and collection of tales evolved slowly and\n          clearly emerged only in the mid- to- late decades of the nineteenth century.\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBodyTitle\">\n          The Zaddik as Conductor\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          One aspect of the zaddik’s role is to set the tone for his community’s spiritual experi-\n          ence. This leadership includes choices and emphases in liturgy, Torah study, perfor-\n          mance of commandments, and in particular, the characteristic rites of hasidic life such\n          as the third Sabbath meal, the singing of melodies, and the like. <span className=\"SuperScript\">14</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; The effective hasidic\n          leader conveys a characteristic style, orchestrating his court’s spiritual experience. <span className=\"SuperScript\">15</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\n          Often the master bequeathed this style to his successor, and in some cases the style was\n          carried forward for a number of generations. Chabad- Lubavitch provides a salient ex-\n          ample, but it is far from being the only one.\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          Each major lineage developed its own distinctive culture and its particular reputa-\n          tion in the constellation of Hasidism as a whole. For one group it was piety, for another\n          sweet melody, for a third fervent prayer, or scholarship, or social welfare and care for\n          the poor, or austere nobility, or efforts to redeem captives unjustly imprisoned, and so\n          on. In the School of Pshiskhe, the reputation surely included individualism and inde-\n          pendence of spirit; Modzitz was famed for its musical compositions and singing; while\n          Worke evoked the mystic transcendence of silence. Wiesel’s chapter on Worke shows\n          how that lineage made silence emotionally expressive, even eloquent. The silence at\n          Worke had its own musical tempo, phrasing, dynamics, even surprise.\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBodyTitle\">\n          The Twentieth Century\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          The zaddik’s role as sacred pivot of his community was concretized in the court itself,\n          whose material patterns and structural design displayed hasidic theology in schema-\n          tized, graphic form. By means of this embodied social theology, the dynastic principle\n          gave prominence to what would otherwise have been very modest locales. Throughout\n          the nineteenth century hasidic centers fostered a protected domain where a quiet and\n          unhurried Hasidism could flourish, luxuriating in a sacred space far from the pace\n          and pressures of urban life. All this changed in the twentieth century, with the move\n          to large cities such as Warsaw, especially during and after World War I. <span className=\"SuperScript\">16</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; During this\n          period we encounter the phenomenon of rebbes named for towns in which they no\n          longer reside.\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          But after World War II and the Holocaust, these towns as places of Jewish life\n          no longer existed at all. The question then became, can a hasidic lineage survive the\n          physical dislocation of the rebbe and then the destruction of the Jewish residents of the\n          town whose name the lineage bears? The answer to this question depended on the fate\n          of the zaddik himself. In general the corporate identity of a hasidic community does\n          not long survive without direct personal contact with a living master. With the living\n          master, there is stability and continuity, a natural focus for the community’s efforts to\n          regroup and rebuild. Almost without exception, it was only when a dynastic scion sur-\n          vived the war that a particular hasidic community was able to reconstitute itself. The\n          postwar hasidic leaders who survived the Shoah and relocated to West ern Europe, Is-\n          rael, or the West ern hemisphere saved the cohesive communities built by their ances-\n          tors from dissipation. Crystallized around family loyalty and the memory of great pre-\n          decessors, the community’s identity remained intact. And the lineage’s identity was\n          also anchored in place: a socially constructed place, the shtetl that no longer existed. <span className=\"SuperScript\">17</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\n          The postwar hasidic master thus achieved a new role and prominence. One may\n          assert that in the entire history of Hasidism, after the eighteenth- century foundational\n          period, the hasidic master is never more crucial than in the post–World War II period.\n          In this period, the lineage’s story (now in clud ing the story of war trauma and survival)\n          and the person who embodies the story mutually reinforce each other as never before.\n          The dynastic narrative (re)constructs the place where the dynasty began, thus giving\n          the incumbent rebbe his identity and his mission. The postwar rebbe is largely a crea-\n          tion of the story of his dynasty, whose shtetl no longer exists. The relationship is re-\n          ciprocal since the story and the place can continue only with a rebbe. If there were noYearning for\n          Lubavitcher Rebbe in the postwar period, there would be no Lubavitch Hasidism today.\n          The same is true of Satmar, Ger, Bobov, Belz, Viznitz, Skver, Karlin- Stolin, Munkacs,\n          and so on. <span className=\"SuperScript\">18</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          Abraham Joshua Heschel wrote, “The seventh day is like a palace in time with a\n          kingdom for all.

When uttering the\n          word “Lubavitch” nowadays, almost no one thinks of a town in Russia. What comes to\n          mind is rather an address in Crown Heights, Brooklyn: 770 East ern Parkway, or simply\n          “770.” This location is linked to a far- flung network of Chabad houses through out the\n          world established by the rebbe, and staffed by idealistic men and women who continue\n          to be motivated by their bond to the rebbe even after his death in 1994.\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBodyTitle\">\n          Postwar Hasidic Renaissance\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          An early, and still arresting, portrait of a postwar hasidic community revived and led\n          by a charismatic master was drawn by Wiesel. The last part of his novel The Gates of the\n          Forest (1966) <span className=\"SuperScript\">20</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; is set in Brooklyn and depicts a fictionalized version of the Lubavitcher\n          rebbe leading a Farbrengen. A major focus of the gathering is song. Wiesel writes,\n          The hasidim sang. The song burst their chests and lit a thousand flames in their\n          eyes. . . . At the far end of the room, facing the door, the Rebbe surrounded by his\n          court, presided over the table of honor. . . . All those present feared and admired him\n          and pledged him fidelity without limit, limning the forces which converged in his\n          person and which he alone could put to use. . . . The hasidim followed him with ra-\n          diant confidence . . . Let him walk first; liberation was at hand! And so they danced\n          with joy, their heads almost touching the vaults of the universe. <span className=\"SuperScript\">21</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          In his memoir All Rivers Run to the Sea, <span className=\"SuperScript\">22</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; writing of Rabbi Menahem Mendel Schneer-\n          son, the Lubavitcher rebbe, Wiesel acknowledges that the hasidic celebration described\n          in The Gates of the Forest “was his celebration. The songs, vows, and fervor of the faith-\n          ful were such that I felt as if I were with my own rebbe, back in my hometown.”\n          The memoir tells of a visit to Lubavitch (that is, to 770 East ern Parkway in Brook-\n          lyn) one year during Simchat Torah. Wiesel stood at the entrance, hoping to avoid at-\n          tention. Suddenly the rebbe noticed him and beckoned him, calling him by name; the\n          Hasidim carried him over the heads of the crowd and deposited him “like a package”\n          in front of the rebbe, who smiled at him. Wiesel recalls the ensuing dialogue as follows:\n          “Welcome,” he said. “It’s nice of a Hasid of Wizhnitz to come and greet us in Lubavitch.\n          But is this how they celebrate Simchat Torah in Wizhnitz?” “Rebbe,” I said faintly,\n          “we are not in Wizhnitz but in Lubavitch.” “Then do as we do in Lubavitch,” he said.\n          “And what do you do in Lubavitch?” “In Lubavitch we drink and say lehayim, to life.”\n          “In Wizhnitz too.” “Very well. Then say lehayim.” He handed me a glass filled to the\n          brim with vodka. “Rebbe,” I said, “in Wizhnitz a Hasid does not drink alone.” “Nor\n          in Lubavitch.” He emptied his glass in one gulp.

It is the\n          living master who bonds the Chabad lineage of Russia and the Viznitzer devotee to a\n          place, to an old- new place where new beginnings are possible and where blessings are\n          effective.\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          The epigraph to The Gates of the Forest is a famous hasidic story. Here is Wiesel’s\n          rendering of it:\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          When the great Rabbi Israel Baal Shem- Tov saw misfortune threatening the Jews it\n          was his custom to go into a certain part of the forest to meditate. There he would\n          light a fire, say a special prayer, and the miracle would be accomplished and the mis-\n          fortune averted.\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          Later, when his disciple, the celebrated Magid of Mezritch, had occasion, for the\n          same reason, to intercede with heaven, he would go to the same place in the forest\n          and say: “Master of the Universe, listen! “I do not know how to light the fire, but I\n          am still able to say the prayer.” And again the miracle would be accomplished.\n          Still later, Rabbi Moshe- Leib of Sasov, in order to save his people once more,\n          would go into the forest and say: “I do not know how to light the fire, I do not know\n          the prayer, but I know the place and this must be sufficient.” It was sufficient and the\n          miracle was accomplished.\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          Then it fell to Rabbi Israel of Ruzhin to overcome misfortune. Sitting in his arm-\n          chair, his head in his hands, he spoke to God: “ I am unable to light the fire and I do\n          not know the prayer; I cannot even find the place in the forest. All I can do is to tell\n          the story, and this must be sufficient.”\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          And it was sufficient.\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          God made man because he loves stories.\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          Gershom Scholem concluded his great survey Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism <span className=\"SuperScript\">23</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; with\n          this story as he heard it from Shmuel Yosef Agnon. Scholem says, “You can say if you\n          will that this profound little anecdote symbolizes the decay of a great movement. You\n          can also say that it reflects the transformation of all its values, a transformation so\n          profound that in the end all that remained of the mystery was the tale.” <span className=\"SuperScript\">24</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; But Wiesel’s\n          deployment of the story suggests something very different. The master remains cen-\n          tral, indeed more central than ever before. A charismatic zaddik such as the Ruzhiner\n          brings the story to life; his storytelling is an act of conjuration, a channeling of power,\n          a translation of lost place to a new location, ultimately a revelation of the salvation em-\n          bedded in the tale.\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          There are interesting variations between the story as presented in English versions\n          and that of the earliest published Hebrew version, Reuven Zak’s Kneset Yisrael of 1906.\n          One line from Zak that is missing in Scholem but is implicit in The Gates of the Forest\n          is this: “The Maggid said, ‘The mystical intentions and prayers of the Baal Shem Tov\n          I don’t know, but I will act by relying upon the Baal Shem Tov’s intention; and this too\n          was accepted by Heaven” (Hebrew: Ha- yihudim ve- hakavvanot she- kivven ha- Besht\n          eini yode’a, rak e’eseh al semakh ha- kavvanah she- kivven ha- Besht, ve- nitkabel gam ken\n          [emphasis mine]). <span className=\"SuperScript\">25</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is clear that this reliance, this leaning, this placement into prox-\n          imity, this concatenation from zaddik to zaddik going back to the Baal Shem Tov, is\n          key to the efficacy of the rite and the story. It is not the story alone that has power, it is\n          the latter- day saint grasping on to what is beyond his own reach: the contemplations\n          of his uniquely illuminated predecessor, the Baal Shem Tov, known through out Hasi-\n          dism as “the Light of the Seven Days of Creation,” that is effective. <span className=\"SuperScript\">26</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          It is worth noting that when this story was told, the Ruzhiner dynasty was no longer\n          in Ruzhin in Russia. It had long since relocated to Sadeger in the Austro- Hungarian\n          empire; after the First World War it was to be found largely in Vienna, and after the\n          Second World War in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem’s Meah Shearim, and New York. <span className=\"SuperScript\">27</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; So Ruzhin\n          is no longer in Ruzhin, just as Lubavitch is no longer in Russia. Lubavitch and Ruzhin\n          reside with their respective rebbe— in some sense, they are the rebbe.\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          The introduction to Legends of Our Time (1968) describes Wiesel’s visit to the Viz-\n          nit zer rebbe in Bnei Brak. The meeting was uncomfortable and tense; the rebbe ap-\n          parently disapproved of Wiesel’s postwar life choices. In the eyes of the Viznitzer, the\n          young writer compared unfavorably with his grandfather Dodye Feig, a fervent Hasid\n          of the old school. Yet the rebbe remembered Wiesel and recognized him instantly. And\n          the rebbe’s presence in Bnei Brak, Israel, was not just ghostly nostalgia but living wit-\n          ness and promise. He had founded and led a community that rose from the ashes and\n          flourished. The vignette of the meeting concludes by describing the Viznitzer’s bless-\n          ing (quite different from, yet still parallel to, that of the Lubavitcher rebbe): “Dodye\n          Feig’s grandson should not go away empty- handed. Come and I shall give you my bless-\n          ing.” Wiesel remarks: “And I did not dare remind him that for so many years I have\n          tried so hard to acquire for myself a name which needed to be blessed, too. Only after\n          I had left him did I realize that perhaps the time has come for Dodye Feig’s grandson\n          to take my place at the typewriter.” This suggests that despite the gap that may have\n          existed— at least in the pious zaddik’s perception— between himself and the worldly\n          writer, the blessing nevertheless took effect and did its work. Perhaps because of the\n          rebbe’s challenge- cum- blessing, the writer is prodded to more clearly express his own\n          voice. The blessing has found its mark even if its aged bestower seems to be laboring in\n          opacity.\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBodyTitle\">\n          Homeward, Bound\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          We now come to the matter of lost childhood and the endless, futile quest for a de-\n          stroyed home. In his most celebrated work, Night, Wiesel describes the deportation of\n          the Jews of Sighet, an event that set into motion the murder of most of Sighet’s Jews,\n          and that ended forever the town’s identity as a place of Jewish residence, as a shtetl.\n          The memory of Wiesel’s loved ones has been a constant theme in his writing, but so\n          has the memory of his town. Indeed, he has returned, or attempted to return, to his\n          birthplace time and again, but each attempt is painful, inconclusive, unfulfilled, be-\n          cause the Jewish town he seeks (as opposed to the geographical location) has been not\n          just destroyed but erased.\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          In Legends of Our Time, <span className=\"SuperScript\">28</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Wiesel collected a group of essays. One of the first es-\n          says in the book, titled “My Teachers,” notes that “After the war I had several opportu-\n          nities to return. . . . I did not return” (9). Yet a later chapter, “The Last Return,” indeed\n          describes a postwar visit to Sighet, in the mid- 1960s. He dreaded the return because\n          “that town they were talking about no longer existed. It had followed the Jews into de-\n          portation” (112). Their very memory had been erased: “The Jews have been driven not\n          only out of the town but out of time as well” (127).\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          The visit is accompanied by pain, disappointment, even elements of farce. A dog\n          barks, startles him, and chases him out of his own backyard. In One Generation After, <span className=\"SuperScript\">29</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\n          where he picks up this narrative, Wiesel describes going to the garden to dig up the\n          gold watch he received as a bar mitzvah gift. He finds the watch and takes it, then feels\n          compelled to go back and rebury it because taking it made him feel like a thief. <span className=\"SuperScript\">30</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\n          The longing to return to the town of his youth motivates many passages in Wie-\n          sel’s writing, and remains present in his life. <span className=\"SuperScript\">31</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; The very last page of the sec ond volume\n          of memoirs, And the Sea Is Never Full, published in 1999, contains the sentence, “And\n          yet I want to go back to Sighet one last time.” <span className=\"SuperScript\">32</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          There is a deep connection between the futile search for a hometown erased from\n          history, on the one hand, and the recognition of the role of zaddikim in Hasidism’s\n          postwar rebirth, on the other hand. Childhood memories are intimately intertwined\n          with the sense of self, one’s feeling of place in the world. <span className=\"SuperScript\">33</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is true that every return to\n          a childhood home is fraught with disappointment brought about by the inevitability\n          of change. But typically change is incremental, accretive, usually most visible at the\n          margins. In Sighet and hundreds of other towns of Jewish Europe, however, the rup-\n          ture was sudden, total, irreversible. Everything ended in the course of a day. Others\n          inhabited the place where Jews had lived and worked for hundreds of years; traces of\n          the earlier residents disappeared. There was almost no “back” to go to; the erasure wasYearning for\n          nearly complete. If there was to be a future, it had to be constructed somewhere else,\n          yet it could be done only by telling the tale of what had once been.\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          So it was that surviving hasidic masters in their way, and Wiesel in his way, were\n          engaged in parallel projects during the postwar years. This connection is brought home\n          in Wiesel’s account of a return to Sighet in the early 1970s. The most intense moment\n          was entering his childhood house. He recounts:\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          What made me realize that I was not at home? A spot on the wall. When the\n          Wizsnitzer Rebbe died in 1936, we received his photo. He was a beautiful man. I re-\n          member putting the nail in the wall and hanging the rebbe’s picture on the wall. The\n          nail was still in the same spot— with a crucifix on it. And when I saw it, I realized if\n          there is no room for the Wizsnitzer Rebbe in my home, there is no room for me ei-\n          ther. And I ran out of the room, out of my home, out of my childhood. <span className=\"SuperScript\">34</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          The “Wizsnitzer Rebbe” of whom Wiesel speaks here (the town’s spelling varies) was\n          Rabbi Israel Hager, born in 1860; the Viznitzer of the Bnei Brak visit recounted in Leg-\n          ends of Our Time was Israel’s son, Rabbi Hayyim Meir Hager (1888–1972). It was the\n          latter Hager who survived the war, emigrated to the land of Israel, and founded Kiryat\n          Wizhnitz in Bnei Brak, said to be the first hasidic neighborhood since the establishment\n          of the State of Israel. <span className=\"SuperScript\">35</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; The dismay of Wiesel’s aborted return to his home is capped by\n          the realization that his beloved rebbe’s picture has been replaced by a crucifix. And yet,\n          the rebbe had a son who revived Viznitz as a thriving community, Viznitz- in- Israel.\n          And the child who nailed the photo on his wall was now a celebrated writer and lec-\n          turer, teaching and engaging new communities of learners, translating and transport-\n          ing Hasidism.\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          If the child of Sighet was able to find so clear and compelling a voice despite the\n          erasure of Jewish Sighet, this was due in part to the ongoing relationship with rebbes—\n          the rebbe of Lubavitch, elsewhere than in Lubavitch; and the rebbe of Viznitz, but not\n          in geographic Viznitz. And Wiesel, by the power of his pen and voice, has been able,\n          in some way, to bring Sighet and all of Jewish Europe back to life, but not in Sighet.\n          We thus return to the story with which we began, the story of Eizik son of Yekel\n          told by Rabbi Simha- Bunam of Pshiskhe. Eizik’s treasure was not to be found away\n          from home, not even in Pshiskhe, but it was the zaddik of Pshiskhe who transmitted\n          this wisdom and told the story to each new disciple. The school of Pshiskhe showed\n          how the teacher- storyteller— that is, the zaddik— and the story itself dovetail; their mu-\n          tual illumination absorbed and encapsulated the meaning of Pshiskhe as a hasidic des-\n          tination. What started out as a geographic center became a climate of the spirit that\n          could be transported and reconstructed anywhere. Perhaps that is why, as modernity en-\n          croached upon and challenged Hasidism ever more aggressively and violently, offshoots\n          of the school of Pshiskhe— Kotsk, Ger, Izbica, Sochachov, Amshinov, and others— have\n          proved resilient, vibrant, able to renew their voice and their vision in new circum-\n          stances and geographic locations, speaking powerfully in a fresh idiom. In truth, any\n          hasidic dynasty that was able to rebuild after nearly complete destruction has absorbed\n          and lived this lesson.\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          There is no comprehensive study, so far as I know, of the miraculous rebirth of ha-\n          sidic dynasties and communities after the Holocaust. <span className=\"SuperScript\">36</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; But the writings and the life of\n          Wiesel show the way such a study must be undertaken— by focusing on the personali-\n          ties of the rebbes, who were able to sing the old- country songs in new lands, who not\n          only told stories but became stories themselves.\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          Souls on Fire has a deeply moving chapter on Rabbi Israel of Ruzhin. One memo-\n          rable story does not appear there but was told by Wiesel in a Boston University class; it\n          might be called the Story of the Pipe. I present the story here, as closely as I can recall\n          it, in tribute to Wiesel as a great teacher, uniquely gifted to bring Hasidism alive in the\n          classroom:\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          A hasid of the Ryzhiner, in order to expand what was already a moderately success-\n          ful enterprise, needed to make a business trip to Paris. A hasid never leaves without\n          first getting his Rebbe’s blessing, but in this case the hasid was hesitant to go to the\n          Ryzhiner, mindful of Paris’s reputation as a center of impious behaviour. He did fi-\n          nally approach his master. To his surprise, the Ryzhiner blessed him enthusiasti-\n          cally, telling him that his trip would be crowned with success, and that in addition\n          he would suffer no spiritual ill effects or adverse influences in Paris. As the audience\n          was ending, the Rebbe grasped the hasid’s hand warmly and said, “By the way, when\n          in Paris would you mind picking up a nice pipe for me? I’ll be happy to pay you.” The\n          hasid responded, “No, of course it will be my gift to the Rebbe!”\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          Apparently the Rebbe’s blessing was effective: the hasid was busy every minute\n          in Paris, contacting suppliers and meeting customers. He even found a synagogue\n          that conducted services according to his custom. He returned to Ryzhin laden with\n          merchandise and new business ideas. Just outside the town, tired but happy, he re-\n          membered the Rebbe’s request— the pipe! He insisted that the carriage turn back and\n          go to the nearest large town with a smoke shop, where he purchased the best pipe in\n          the store. Entering Ryzhin once again, he went to greet the Rebbe even before going\n          to his own home. He reported to the Rebbe on the success of his visit and that thank\n          God he did not succumb to any of the temptations of the big city. And then, without\n          making any claims about its origin, he presented the Rebbe with the pipe. The Rebbe\n          smiled and said, “Yankel, please be seated. I have two questions to ask you. Number\n          one, don’t you think I know where you got the pipe? And number two, do you think\n          I really wanted a new pipe? What I wanted was that when you would be in Paris that\n          you would remember that you have a Rebbe in Ryzhin.”\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          This Ruzhin story highlights the centrality of hiskashrus, of bonding with one’s master\n          over space and time. The story is self- referential, suggesting that the story itself can\n          foster and maintain hiskashrus. One can be in Paris but can live in Ruzhin. One can\n          live in Boston or New York and live in Lubavitch and Viznitz.Yearning for\n          The world has shifted violently and irrevocably. But in the face of disruption, dis-\n          placement, and erasure, Hasidism has survived and even flourished by reconstituting\n          itself around the triad of zaddik–story–place. Wiesel has described this process in a\n          compelling, persuasive manner; he has lived it. His sensitivity to the power of person,\n          place, and narrative may be behind his unforgettable prophetic assertion, the moment\n          of speaking of truth to power, when he said to a U.S. president, “That place is not your\n          place.” <span className=\"SuperScript\">37</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          In contrast, the place of learning and teaching of human dignity, of quest and shar-\n          ing: this place is Wiesel’s place.\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          Jewish, Literary, and Moral Perspectives\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          Edited by Steven T.

Jeremy Dauber has shown convincingly that early hasidic stories generally avoid realistic rep-\n          resentation of spatial location. He argues that the reason for eschewing mimetic representation is\n          ideological: “representation, description at a distance, mediated texts, is no substitute for direct con-\n          tact with the Zaddik . . . , who is able to perceive ‘the real truth’ and to articulate it.” Jeremy Dauber,\n          “Looking at the Yiddish Landscape: Representation in Nineteenth- Century Hasidic and Maskilic Lit-\n          erature,” in Shtetl: New Evaluations, ed. Steven T. Katz (New York: New York University Press, 2006),\n          140–78; the quote is on 147. But Dauber focuses on Shivhei HaBesht and Rabbi Nachman’s Tales, both\n          published around 1815; it is the change that takes place as the nineteenth century unfolds that we are\n          tracing here. The process whereby hasidic zaddikim became increasingly identified with Polish towns\n          and cities and oft en came to control them is vividly described by Glenn Dynner in Men of Silk: The\n          Hasidic Conquest of Polish Jewish Society (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006).\n          8. One such town, Kozienice, is depicted in a memoir of a descendant of the founder, Rabbi Israel\n          Hapstein.

The economic aspects of Hasidic Royal Courts are vividly described by David Assaf in The\n          Regal Way: The Life and Times of Rabbi Israel of Ruzhin, trans. David Louvish (Stanford, Calif.: Stan-\n          ford University Press, 2002); see esp. 267–324.\n          11. Steven Katz has written of the need for attending to the role (that is, the social function) of re-\n          telling tales in hasidic life, as well as considering the differences between the vari ous hasidic lineages.\n          See Steven T. Katz, Post- Holocaust Dialogues: Critical Studies in Modern Jewish Thought (New York:\n          New York University Press, 1985), 77. Joseph Dan, in The Hasidic Story— Its History and Development\n          [in Hebrew] (Jerusalem: Keter, 1975), 235–38, distinguishes between collections of hasidic tales pub-\n          lished by maskilim and other “outsiders,” in contrast to tales collected and published by “insiders.”\n          These latter tend to focus on one lineage— the one of which the editor is an adherent. These efforts,\n          Dan observes, are in effect monographs on the lineage and its masters, tend to downplay the miracu-\n          lous and fabulous, and contain much of solid his tori cal value. It may be added that these collections\n          tend to highlight the wisdom of the particular lineage’s masters as captured in their aphorisms and\n          parables, and the vignettes told about them.\n          12. Wiesel, Somewhere a Master: Further Hasidic Portraits and Legends (New York: Summit Books,\n          1982), 175; emphasis and formatting mine. I have attempted to hear these words as they likely were\n          spoken by their author; it should be recalled that most of the published essays were delivered orally,\n          and that the poetic cadences— and silences— are an important aspect of Wiesel’s powerful eloquence.\n          13. There is a similar pattern in Souls on Fire where the chapter called “The School of Pshyshke”\n          comes after ten chapters whose headings name an early master or his disciples.\n          14. On this see A. Wertheim, Law and Custom in Chassidism [in Hebrew] (Jerusalem: Mossad\n          Harav Kook, 1960).\n          15. The role of hasidic masters in orchestrating melody during prayer services was noted by the\n          early anti- hasidic polemicist David of Makov. Writing about Rabbi Hayyim- Heikel and his court in\n          Amdur during the years 1773–87, he quotes an enthusiast as follows: “Our Rebbe has a very sweet voice\n          and knows how to sing songs as do all those who pray with him. . . . Our master Heike’s honey- toned\n          melodies are surpassingly pleasing. He beats time with both his hands, clapping them together, as\n          [the hasidim] respond in harmonious chorus.” See Mordecai Wilensky, Hasidim and Mitnaggedim,\n          vol. 2 (Jerusalem: Bialik Institute, 1990), 173; Wolf Zeev Rabinowitsch, Lithuanian Hasidism (New\n          York: Schocken Books, 1971), 128. A recent article that explores linkages between musical conduct-\n          ing and charismatic spiritual leadership is Stephen Cottrell, “Music, Time, and Dance in Orchestral\n          Performance: The Conductor as Shaman,” Twentieth- Century Music 3, no. 1 (2007): 73–96.\n          16. The displacement of Abraham Joshua Heschel’s aristocratic hasidic family from the country-\n          side to major cities such as Vienna and Warsaw during the Great War is described by Edward Kaplan\n          and Samuel Dresner in Abraham Joshua Heschel: Prophetic Witness (New Haven, Conn.: Yale Uni-\n          versity Press, 1998). See esp. 34 on the relocation of Heschel’s uncle, Rabbi Alter Israel Shimon Per-\n          low, to Warsaw. Throughout his Warsaw years until his death in 1933, this saintly fig ure was known\n          as the “Novominsker Rebbe.”\n          17. Joseph Dan has noted that the main factor securing the miraculous contemporary rebirth\n          of hasidic communities in the aftermath of the Holocaust was “adherence to their hereditary tzad-\n          dikim.” See Joseph Dan, “Hasidism: The Third Century,” in Jewish Mysticism, vol. 4: General Charac-\n          teristics and Comparative Studies (Northvale, N.J.: Jason Aronson, 1999), 67–85; “The Contemporary\n          Hasidic Tzaddik: Charisma, Heredity, Magic, and Miracle,” ibid., 111–30.\n          18. The fate of Alexander (Alexandrov, near Lodz) Hasidism is instructive as a counterexample.\n          Before the Second World War, it was one of the largest hasidic groups in Poland, rivaling Ger in num-Yearning for\n          bers and influence. But while the Gerer rebbe escaped to Eretz Israel and began the rebuilding of his\n          community, almost all the Danziger heirs were killed, and Alexander has to this day not recovered\n          its former prominence. See Tzvi M. Rabinowicz, The Encyclopedia of Hasidism (Northvale, NJ: Jason\n          Aronson, 1996), 84, s.v. “Danziger, Yitzhak Menahem Mendel, of Alexander (1880–1943).”\n          19.

A similar point is made by the lead story in Yaffa Eliach’s Hasidic Tales of the Holocaust (New\n          York: Oxford University Press, 1982). The story, told by the rabbi of Bluzhov, Rabbi Israel Spira, is\n          one of survival by means of a seemingly impossible feat, jumping over a large, yawning pit. The frail\n          rabbi and a friend close their eyes, jump, and make it to the other side alive. As Eliach tells the story,\n          the rabbi’s young friend asks him:\n          “Tell me, Rebbe, how did you do it?”\n          “I was holding on to my ancestral merit. I was holding on to the coattails of my father,\n          and my grandfather and my great- grandfather, of blessed memory,” said the rabbi and his\n          eyes searched the black skies above. “Tell me, my friend, how did you reach the other side of\n          the pit?”\n          “I was holding on to you,” replied the rabbi’s friend.

These works, written by dynastic insiders, are entirely\n          appreciative and noncriti cal, but contain much valuable information. See, for example, Menachem\n          Brayer, The House of Rizhin (New York: Mesorah Publications, 2003); Yisroel Friedman, The Rebbes\n          of Chortkov (New York: Mesorah Publications, 2003).\n          28.

Notable in this connection is the\n          account in All Rivers, 12–13, on the elder Rabbi Israel of Viznitz’s last visit to Sighet, where he is said\n          to have told Wiesel’s mother: “Sarah, know that your son will become a gadol b’Israel, a great man\n          in Israel, but neither you nor I will live to see the day.” This would have taken place sometime in the\n          mid- 1930s.\n          35.

Belcove- Shalin, ed., New World Hasidism: Ethnographic Studies of Ha-\n          sidic Jews in America (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1995). Belcove- Shalin’s chapter\n          “Home in Exile: Hasidism in the New World,” 205–36, has a fine sketch of the Bobover rebbe and his\n          achievement in reestablishing a flourishing Bobover community in Boro Park, Brooklyn; also note-\n          worthy is the chapter by Solomon Poll, “The Charismatic Leader of the Hasidic Community: The\n          Zaddiq, the Rebbe,” 257–75.

Shaul Shimon Deutsch, Larger Than Life: The\n          Life and Times of the Lubavitcher Rebbe Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, 2 vols. (New York: Cha-\n          sidic His tori cal Productions, 1995–97), reproduces many rare primary documents and is a treasure\n          trove of information, but this multivolume biography has thus far covered only Rabbi Schneer son’s\n          early years. Elliot R. Wolfson has made an important contribution to our appreciation of the depth,\n          subtlety, and power of Rabbi Schneerson’s thought with his Open Secret: Postmessianic Messianism\n          and the Mystical Revision of Menahem Mendel Schneerson (New York: Columbia University Press,\n          2009).

Katz insightfully remarks that Rabbi Menahem\n          Mendel Schneerson forged “a post- Shoah group identity around a distinctly Ameri can leader who\n          was also the spiritual repository of the six preceding Russian leaders” (55, abstract)\n          37.

And the Lord showed him all the\n        Land, even Gilead as far as Dan; and all Naphtali, and the land of\n        Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah as far as the hinder\n        sea. . . .

And He buried him in the val-\n        ley of the land of Moab. . . . And no person knows of his sepulchre unto\n        this day. And Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died; his\n        eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated. And the children of Israel\n        wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days; and the days of weeping\n        in the mourning for Moses were ended. . . . And there hath not arisen a\n        prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face;\n        in all the signs and wonders, which the Lord sent him to do in the land\n        of Egypt . . . and in all the mighty hand, and in all the awesome deeds,\n        which Moses wrought in the sight of all Israel. (Deut. 34:1–12)\n        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n        Near the beginning of the Pentateuch God forms the first human out of the\n        dust of the earth and blows the breath of life into his nostrils (Gen. 2:7). The\n        biblical narrative starts with God fashioning Adam by His own hands, vivify-\n        ing—actually inflating—him by applying the divine mouth to His creature’s\n        face. Now at the end of the Pentateuch, in Deuteronomy 34, God decommis-\n        sions his most trusted servant in the privacy of Pisgah. The second half of\n        verse 5, translated as “according to the word of the Lord,” reads in\n        Hebrew al pi Adonai, literally “by the mouth of the Lord.” The Talmud under-\n        stands this to mean that Moses was taken by a Divine kiss. In other words,\n        God’s mouth once again touches the mouth of His creature—we can imagine\n        the strength of the seal formed by that intimate contact—and God withdraws\n        the breath He had emplaced long before. And just as God formed Adam with\n        His own hands, so now does God return Moses to the earth in the same man-\n        ner: “And He buried him in the valley of the land of Moab” (v. 6).<span className=\"SuperScript\">2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n        These last verses of the Torah are discussed in a passage of the Babylonian\n        Talmud (b. Baba Batra 14b–15a; cf. b. Menahot 30a),<span className=\"SuperScript\">3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;which asks, “Who wrote\n        the Scriptures?” This crucial question, posed in such a disarmingly direct man-\n        ner, sets off a long discussion of the books of the Bible. The passage begins with\n        the statement that “Moses wrote his own book and the portion of Balaam and\n        Job. Joshua wrote the book which bears his name and [the last] eight verses\n        of the Pentateuch.” This last assertion is established by reference to Deuteron-\n        omy 34:5, “So Moses the servant of the Lord died there.” “Now is it pos-\n        sible that Moses while still alive<span className=\"SuperScript\">4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;would have written the words, ‘Moses died\n        there’? The truth is, however, that up to this point Moses wrote, from this point\n        Joshua wrote.” This view, attributed to Rabbi Judah (or, according to another\n        tradition, to Rabbi Nehemia), is challenged by Rabbi Simeon: “Can [we imag-\n        ine the] scroll of the Torah being short of one word, and is it not written, Take\n        this book of the Torah (Deut. 31:26)? No; what we must say is that up to this\n        point the Holy One, blessed be He, dictated and Moses repeated and wrote,\n        and from this point God dictated and Moses wrote in tears.”\n        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n        A troubling dilemma: If Moses wrote the last eight verses, then he appar-\n        ently wrote an untruth, for Deuteronomy 34:5 could not have been accurate\n        at the moment he was writing. But if Moses didn’t write the last verses, then\n        the Torah scroll would have been incomplete and thus not a true Torah scroll.\n        The paradox is deeper still when we reflect on verse 10: “And there hath\n        not arisen a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the Lord\n        knew face to face.” This verse underscores the uniqueness of the Mosaic\n        prophecy and thus the primacy of the Pentateuch in the biblical canon.<span className=\"SuperScript\">5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;For\n        Jews, of course, the Pentateuch is the foundation and generative core of the en-\n        tire Bible.

What does it do to the primacy of\n        Mosaic prophecy if it was a subsequent disciple, a lesser prophet, who made\n        this very assertion?\n        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n        The question gains troubling power when we note the astonishing sweep of\n        “And there hath not arisen a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses.”\n        This is a not a prospective statement that looks forward to a distant future but\n        a retrospective statement, a categorical declaration spoken from a position of\n        finality, of “last things,” sealing not only the Pentateuch but the entirety of\n        prophetic activity in Judaism by espying all of history in its rear-facing view. In\n        the vastness of its sweep it surely rivals Genesis’s “In the beginning God cre-\n        ated . . .” Taken together, Genesis 1 and Deuteronomy 34 are bookends that\n        frame the Pentateuch; they are the ultimate assertions of God-as-Omniscient-\n        Narrator.<span className=\"SuperScript\">7</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n        That is not all. The last part of verse<span className=\"SuperScript\">10</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;is also notable: “whom the Lord\n        knew face to face.” Not that Moses knew God face-to-face—but that God\n        knew Moses. In its focus on the singular quality of God’s connection to His\n        servant, it goes beyond other passages such as Numbers 12:6–8, whose main\n        concern is the unique character of Moses. Here the stress is the intimacy of the\n        Divine knowing—yeda’o, using the same verb the early chapters of Genesis\n        employ for carnal knowledge: “and Adam knew Eve his wife” (Gen. 4:1).<span className=\"SuperScript\">8</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;        With the intensity of this spiritual eros, it is no wonder that (as our Talmud\n        passage tells us) Moses deviated from scribal convention and did not repeat\n        the words dictated to him.\n        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n        Jewish tradition largely settled on the view of Rabbi Simeon that Moses\n        himself wrote the final verses as being more consistent with the special posi-\n        tion of the Torah (“the Five Books of Moses”) in the biblical canon. But what\n        about the problem of Moses writing of his death in the past tense? Commen-\n        tators noted a striking ambiguity in the phrase, “Moses wrote in tears”: it could\n        be understood to mean that Moses wept as he wrote; or that Moses wrote the\n        words with tears—instead of ink.<span className=\"SuperScript\">9</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n        The image of Moses weeping as he wrote has emotional poignancy but does\n        not seem fully consistent with Moses’ character in the rest of the Pentateuch.\n        Unlike Jacob, Moses does not weep when he meets his wife-to-be at the well\n        (Exod. 2:15–21; cf. Gen. 29:11). When God threatens to destroy Israel in the\n        aftermath of the Golden Calf episode and Moses insists that their sin be for-\n        given, his steely defiance includes a cool invitation for God to “erase me from\n        the book which You have written” (Exod. 32:32). So it is surprising that\n        Moses would weep in self-pity at the inscription of his death. It is also sugges-\n        tive that in Deuteronomy 34 itself, we are told that “the children of Israel\n        wept for Moses” (v. 8); by contrast, “[Moses’] eye was undimmed” (v. 7).\n        Since one consequence of weeping is a blurring of vision, a dimming of the\n        eye, the statement that his eye was not dim actually suggests that as the end\n        approached, Moses did not weep. For all these reasons, it is preferable to\n        understand the Talmudic passage as meaning that Moses wrote the words with\n        tears.\n        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n        One must imagine here a kind of scribal darkroom with time as the sacred\n        fixative, so that the tears gradually turn into ink, disclosing their message after\n        Moses had in fact died, thereby skirting the paradox: at the time he wrote in\n        tears the message was not yet readable.<span className=\"SuperScript\">10</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;The special character of the Torah as\n        God’s word and yet “the Torah of Moses” is upheld.<span className=\"SuperScript\">11</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n        But if Moses did not weep, whose tears are these, with which Moses wrote?\n        In the death scene of last eight verses, there are after all two characters,\n        Moses and God. Could the tears be not those of the servant but of the Master?\n        The suggestion that the tears were God’s is less startling when we recall the\n        importance of divine pathos in rabbinic thought. As Henry Slonimsky puts it,\n        “The Midrashic imagination is unabashed and strips God of the usual pomp\n        and power. . . . When the enemies had destroyed the Temple, . . . [w]e have\n        a God in tears . . . refusing to be robbed of the supreme prerogative of the\n        heart to weep and to suffer compassion.”<span className=\"SuperScript\">12</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike later philosophical exposi-\n        tions of Judaism, the Talmud and classical Midrashim are full of anthropo-\n        morphic and anthropopathic imagery. For the Midrash (again quoting\n        Slonimsky), “if anyone can be said to be in need of comfort it is God, not\n        Israel.”<span className=\"SuperScript\">13</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus it is entirely possible that the Talmud meant that God was\n        weeping—for the loss of His most trusted servant and intimate friend.\n        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n        This possibility gains likelihood when we recall that the rabbis consistently\n        portray the relationship between God and Moses as intimately personal,\n        including an aspect of physical contact. In this they are following Scripture\n        itself, with such passages as Exodus 33 and 34, where Moses asks God to show\n        him His Glory, meaning His visible form. Working out a strategy for Moses to\n        survive the experience, God puts Moses in the cleft of the rock and protects\n        him with His palm. And as noted above, God Himself buries Moses. Expand-\n        ing on this, the Talmud Sotah 13b describes how Moses was carried from the\n        portion of Reuben to the portion of Gad, cradled in the wings of the Shekhinah,\n        which Rashi explains to mean “in the flap of God’s Garment of Radiance.”<span className=\"SuperScript\">14</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;        This intimate relationship is compared by the Midrash to that between hus-\n        band and wife.<span className=\"SuperScript\">15</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the intimacy of God’s direct contact with Moses plays a\n        role in the rabbinic understanding of how Torah was given. We are told that\n        Moses acquired his radiant countenance (beams of light: Exod. 34:29–35)\n        while the Tablets were being passed from God’s hands to Moses’ hands.<span className=\"SuperScript\">16</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;The\n        Tablets were six handbreadths wide; God’s hands held two handbreadths,\n        Moses’ hands held two, with two handbreadths of stone separating hand from\n        Hand.<span className=\"SuperScript\">17</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the residue of that brush with the Divine became the rays of light\n        beaming out of Moses’ face.\n        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n        Michael Fishbane cites the early midrash Sifre Deuteronomy (343), which\n        describes God’s word emerging as fire from His right hand, eventually inscrib-\n        ing itself on the tablets of Moses. Fishbane notes that in the midrashic myth,\n        “God’s word emerges from the divine essence as visible fire and takes instruc-\n        tional shape as letters and words upon the tablets.”<span className=\"SuperScript\">18</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;While that passage refers\n        to the tablets, we are arguing that our Talmudic passage should be understood\n        in a similar way: tears emerge from the divine self and, with the help of Moses,\n        are inscribed upon the parchment of the first Torah scroll.\n        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n        Finally, the midrash Deuteronomy Rabbah on our passage makes God’s tears\n        explicit: “God kissed Moses and took away his soul with a kiss of the mouth,\n        and God, if one may say so, wept.”<span className=\"SuperScript\">19</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;The only element added by the Talmudic\n        passage in Baba Batra then would be that Moses used those divine tears to\n        inscribe the last eight verses and defeat the paradox of a self-referential\n        account of one’s death. Moses thus emerges as the exemplar of the human con-\n        dition, the quintessential person whose life is sealed in the tears of others,\n        whose achievement is only revealed in retrospect, after taking leave of the\n        stage.\n        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n        Just as Moses stands revealed by the last verses of the Torah, so does God. If\n        the tears are His, we discover that He, too, suffers. He grieves with His cre-\n        ation, laments its pain, feels the anguish of its thwarted yearnings and unreal-\n        ized visions.<span className=\"SuperScript\">20</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;For to have made a creature out of the dust, even such a one as\n        Moses, means to have scoped a compass of finitude. As noted above, the Torah\n        begins with God’s handiwork exiled from the Garden, and it ends with His ser-\n        vant gazing at the Promised Land from afar. The exile, the unfinished nature\n        of the work, cannot but reflect on the Maker as well; in weeping for Moses,\n        God acknowledges His own entanglement in what He has wrought. God is\n        implicated in finitude and that awareness made tears flow—God’s own tears.\n        And as God showed Moses the Land from the top of Pisgah, the Temple was\n        still hundreds of years in the future, and its destruction hundreds of years\n        beyond that, but it was all visible then and there. Who could not but weep?\n        God wept at the death of His greatest prophet and most devoted servant. As\n        the divine mouth sought out the mouth of the son of Amram, tears flowed\n        from one face to the other face. “The Lord knew Moses”: a pouring of the self\n        into the other, completing the other, thus completing the self. For the crown\n        of Divine greatness is just this, that God suffers with His creatures, shedding\n        tears: transcendence melting into finitude.\n        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n        The only God known to Jews is the God who has poured Himself onto\n        parchment, who so loved His servant that He wept over that creature’s death\n        and by weeping, disclosed His own implication in finitude.<span className=\"SuperScript\">21</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tears are the only\n        disclosing solvent for the Absolute.<span className=\"SuperScript\">22</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;This, then, is the Torah’s coda, the sum-\n        mit to which everything preceding has aimed. The capstone of the Torah is\n        the Divine weeping, the Divine eulogy for Moses; it is God’s mourning the loss\n        of His love relationship with Moses, thereby revealing the truth and power of\n        that love for him and by extension for Israel and the world. How, after all,\n        could the Torah—inscribing the wisdom of the Infinite One—end; how could\n        it remain other than perpetually open? It could only be brought to closure by88\n        those eight verses, signaling the Divine passion, the Divine engagement with\n        Moses, the Divine willingness to be affected by humanity’s greatest exemplars\n        and thus by all humanity.\n        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n        The power of the Talmudic reading emerges when we note that by its light,\n        34:10 is self-referential. “And there hath not arisen a prophet since in Israel like\n        unto Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face”—at that very moment, the moment\n        of death. If the key to prophecy is relationship, never was the divine-human rela-\n        tionship stronger than when mouth pressed against mouth, when vital ocular\n        fluid flowed from the Holy Ancient One onto the face of the servant, running\n        down his beard, down his robe, like the dew of Hermon, onto the scroll: for there\n        God ordained blessing. A death that was life for evermore. The last eight verses,\n        and by extension the entire Torah, become a completion cycle and a love letter.\n        And it is just this secret of divine weeping that explains how Moses could\n        have written those final verses. For how could even the most humble of men\n        write “And there hath not arisen a prophet since in Israel like unto\n        Moses” with equanimity? Only by focusing on God’s emotions, not his own.\n        Had Moses wept, his writing would have drowned in a sea of self-regard and\n        subjectivity. It was his contemplation of God’s weeping that enabled him to\n        transcend the natural tendency to human subjectivity and to complete the\n        work from God’s perspective—that is, to write the Five Books of Moses as\n        sacred scripture, as the cornerstone of everything that is to come in Judaism.\n        The tradition of ascribing profound emotions to God was largely neglected or\n        suppressed by the medieval Jewish philosophers. Such great thinkers as Mai-\n        monides conceived of God as pure intellect; it followed that the only way to\n        approach the divine was by cultivating one’s intellect at the expense of other\n        aspects of the human psyche. These tendencies were to some degree balanced\n        and corrected by the flourishing of the Kabbalah, but the full return of the\n        personal, passionate God of the Bible, Talmud, and Midrash awaited the Ha-\n        sidic movement in the eighteenth century. Hasidism promoted devekut—\n        “communion with God”—as a central religious value. In some Hasidic circles\n        devekut was understood as loss of ego, the individual self merging with the\n        Absolute. But alongside this tendency there was also a personalistic under-\n        standing of God, who bore close resemblance to the deity of Tanakh and clas-\n        sic Aggadah, and who could be approached by the individual hasid in prayer\n        and other modes of devoted relationship. In the tales and folk traditions of the\n        movement, the mode of dialogic intimacy held a far more prominent place\n        than that of acosmism and merging with the Absolute, but it must be under-\n        stood that part of the genius of Hasidism is that the two approaches were seen\n        to complement rather than conflict with each other.\n        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n        Alongside devekut, another keyword in Hasidism is hitkashrut—“bonding.”\n        What devekut describes for the hasid in relation to God, hitkashrut portrays for\n        the relationship between the hasid and the master, known as the rebbe or zad-\n        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n        dik. The ideal is for the rebbe and hasid to bond soul to soul, heart to heart, des-\n        tiny to destiny. The bonding is mutual and reciprocal: the hasid bonds himself\n        to the rebbe and the rebbe to hasid; but the hasid also bonds himself to that\n        which the rebbe holds dear. Through attachment to the rebbe, even the sim-\n        plest hasid is in touch with God, Torah, and the Hasidic community.\n        The story of the growth and spread of Hasidism throughout Eastern Europe\n        has been told elsewhere; our concern here is to suggest that for all the com-\n        plexity and diversity of Hasidic spirituality, the inner life of the movement\n        might be grasped by focusing on the two themes of devekut and hitkashrut:\n        bonding to God, to the rebbe, and the community of fellow hasidim.\n        With this emphasis in mind we might approach the master who penned the\n        final work of Hasidic teachings in Poland, Rabbi Kalonymos Kalmish Shapiro\n        (1889–1943).<span className=\"SuperScript\">23</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Known as the Rebbe of Piaseczno, he was a multifaceted per-\n        sonality who served as leader to an intellectual elite as well as to the desper-\n        ately poor common folk of interwar Poland. Famed as a pedagogue and\n        educational theorist, he was also celebrated for his knowledge of medicine. In\n        the Warsaw Ghetto, as Polish Jewry went through its death agony, Rabbi\n        Shapiro continued to teach, to lead, to give material and spiritual support, and\n        finally to show how it is possible to maintain a radiant faith in the midst of the\n        deepest darkness and despair. His last book, which he referred to as “Torah\n        insights from the years of wrath 5700–5702 [1939–1942],” was among the\n        manuscripts he buried in 1943, shortly before the complete destruction of\n        the ghetto. The manuscript was discovered after the war and was eventually\n        published in Israel under the title Esh Kodesh (Fire of holiness). Composed dur-\n        ing a time of utter personal crisis and communal devastation, after he had\n        already lost most of his family, it is the last work of Hasidism written in Poland.<span className=\"SuperScript\">24</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n        The great theme of Esh Kodesh is weeping—divine weeping. Rabbi Shapiro\n        revisits the aggadic passages on God’s tears and through them finds a language\n        to address his community in faithfulness and integrity. The theme of divine\n        suffering enables him to rise above the most likely, understandable response:\n        the silence of collapse and despair. It also allows him to avoid the platitudes of\n        theodicy, to avoid sounding notes that (no matter how holy) would not have\n        rung true in that time and place. Instead, he embraces the midrashic image of\n        God weeping alone in His Inner Chambers, and avers that the hasid can push\n        in, join his tears with God’s, communing with God in suffering, just as at hap-\n        pier times we commune with God in shared joy.\n        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n        As he wrote in March 1942, shortly before the destruction of the Warsaw\n        Ghetto:\n        God, blessed be He, is to be found in His inner chambers weeping, so that one\n        who pushes in and comes close to Him by means of studying Torah, weeps\n        together with God, and studies Torah with Him. Just this makes the difference:\n        the weeping, the pain which a person undergoes by himself, alone, may have the90\n        effect of breaking him, of bringing him down, so that he is incapable of doing any-\n        thing. But the weeping which the person does together with God—that strength-\n        ens him. He weeps—and is strengthened; he is broken—but finds courage to study\n        and teach. It is hard to raise one’s self up, time and again, from the tribulations,\n        but when one is determined, stretching his mind to connect to the Torah and\n        Divine service, then he enters the Inner Chambers where the Blessed Holy One\n        is to be found; he weeps and wails together with Him, as it were, and even finds\n        the strength to study Torah and serve Him.<span className=\"SuperScript\">25</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n        What matters most for Rabbi Shapiro and for Hasidism is relationship.\n        Relationship with the other, compassion for the other, suffering with the other\n        is itself a kind of redemption. For what is redemption if not the finding of our\n        most fully human self, in the act of imitatio Dei? It is not just that God suffers\n        with us, for us, because we suffer, but that God is most God when He suffers;\n        He comes most into Himself when He identifies with Israel, with her human-\n        ity, her vulnerability, her personal and collective destiny. Similarly, we become\n        most like God when we transcend our own suffering, when we participate in\n        the suffering of others and in the suffering of God. Because God is God, He\n        suffers most intensely, infinitely; His suffering must remain hidden. But\n        because God remains God, He also remains the hope for redemption in a con-\n        crete sense. Because humans are human, they do not decide when or how to\n        end their suffering or to claim to know its meaning. But, because humans are\n        human, they can arouse themselves, take hold of inner, hidden resources—in\n        other words, grasp their faith—and thereby hope to arouse God to once again\n        announce His redemptive presence in a world that still awaits Him.\n        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n        The tears Rabbi Shapiro shed for his own family and community, for\n        humanity, for God, fell on sheets of paper and emerged as words of Torah,\n        words of Hasidism.

Sotah 14a, the Talmudic passage enjoining\n        human imitation of God’s compassionate acts: “Rabbi Simlai expounded: Torah begins\n        with an act of benevolence and ends with an act of benevolence. It begins with an act\n        of benevolence, for it is written, And the Lord God made for Adam and for his\n        wife coats of skin, and He clothed them (Gen. 3:21); and it ends with an act of\n        benevolence, for it is written, and He buried him in the valley (Deut. 34:6).”\n        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n        3. This passage sets out the proper sequence of the biblical books when copied on a\n        single scroll. It has been the subject of scrutiny by scholars interested in the formation\n        of the biblical canon. See Sid Z. Leiman, The Canonization of Hebrew Scripture: The Tal-\n        mudic and Midrashic Evidence (Hamden, CT: Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sci-\n        ences, 1976); Louis Jacobs, Structure and Form in the Babylonian Talmud (New York:\n        Cambridge University Press, 1991), ch. 3.\n        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n        4. Following the version in b. Menahot 30a, Baba Batra has “having died.” While the\n        point is the same with either reading, we follow the Menahot version because it high-\n        lights the problem with greater clarity. Our aggadah as found in the Babylonian Talmud\n        is a much expanded exposition of an earlier midrashic theme. Compare the earlier Sifre\n        on Deuteronomy, ed. Louis Finkelstein (New York: Jewish Theological Seminary of\n        America, 1969), 427.\n        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n        5. See b.

But its placement at\n        the end of the Torah clearly elevates its rhetorical moment; it is the Torah’s coda, its\n        final comment on Moses and itself.\n        <br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n        7.

The very factors that contribute to the interest and\n      importance of mystical leaders—charismatic attraction, paranormal\n      powers, and the like—leave behind a veil of unclarity that makes\n      assessment of historical evidence more difficult than usual. These\n      issues have beset attempts to reconstruct the figure of the founder of\n      Hasidism, Israel ben Eliezer, known as the Baal Shem Tov. The\n      appearance of Immanuel Etkes’s The Besht: Magician, Mystic, and Leader\n      is thus a cause for celebration, for Etkes, a highly regarded Israeli\n      historian, has produced a study of the Baal Shem Tov which is\n      methodologically sound, firmly grounded on historical evidence, and—\n      most importantly—succeeds in bringing the personality of this mystical\n      leader to life.\n      <br/><br/>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n      As the title indicates, Etkes’s portrait focuses on three main areas\n      of the work of the Baal Shem Tov (often abbreviated to ‘Besht’):\n      magician, mystic and leader. Under the first rubric, Etkes discusses the\n      Baal Shem Tov as a practitioner of applied kabbalah, that is, an adept\n      at theurgic use of divine Names. This is perhaps the most well-known\n      aspect of the Besht’s activities, hardly unique to Israel ben Eliezer but\n      shared with a number of other baalei shem of this historical period.\n      However, Etkes points to the decisive element of personal charisma in\n      the case of the Besht. As Etkes writes, the Besht’s charisma ‘‘was\n      expressed through such near-prophetic powers such as the ability to\n      see from afar, to tell futures, to discover a soul’s previous incarnations,\n      and so forth.’’ (p. 78) While some of these powers may have been\n      shared by other baalei shem, ‘‘we do not know of any baal shem to\n      whom so full a range of traits could be attributed.’’ (Ibid.)\n      As a leader, the Baal Shem Tov saw himself as ‘‘bearing\n      responsibility for the Jewish people as a whole.’’ (p. 79) In the face\n      of attacks from outside the Jewish community and social tensions\n      ß The Author 2008.

While much of this\n      activity involved relatively conventional leadership efforts, some of it\n      involved heavenly intercession in the pattern of a biblical prophet.\n      On celestial journeys, the Besht intervened to save individual souls,\n      and attempted to avert calamities threatening the Jewish people.\n      In these activities he meets and converses with various extraordinary\n      figures such as the Messiah and even Satan. By his own account, the\n      Besht’s intercessory efforts were not always successful, and skeptics\n      would naturally dismiss these episodes as pious fantasy and delusion.\n      But the point is that the Besht believed in his own cosmic role and\n      heavenly influence, and his disciples did as well. As Etkes shows, the\n      image of the Baal Shem Tov as concerned and confident intercessor\n      for Jews in both the terrestrial and supernal realms was decisive for\n      the development of Hasidism, and nurtured the ideal of the hasidic\n      zaddik in later generations.\n      <br/><br/>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n      Etkes’s depiction of the Besht as mystic is particularly strong.\n      Placing ecstatic prayer at the center of the Besht’s religious life, Etkes\n      argues that dvekut (union with God) was an experience that permeated\n      the Besht’s outlook at all times. While ecstasy, involving involuntary\n      shaking of the body, was by nature brief and episodic, it nevertheless\n      colored the Besht’s view of reality, since it was the experiential\n      correlate to the doctrine of Divine immanence and the presence of\n      God in all things. The Besht’s Dvekut was an experience of intense\n      pleasure which undergirded his robust affirmation of the world as\n      permeated with divinity, his confident embrace of the physical, and his\n      denial that evil had independent metaphysical reality.\n      <br/><br/>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n      Not only does Etkes provide vivid portrayals of the three major\n      domains of the Besht’s functioning, he convincingly demonstrates how\n      the three areas nurtured and reinforced each other. Because the Baal\n      Shem Tov was a successful applied kabbalist, he had reason to travel\n      widely, visiting many communities and meeting individuals of all\n      stations. With an intimate knowledge of the Jewish world of his day,\n      he was aware of the problems Jews faced and was well positioned to\n      serve in a leadership role. Similarly, his charismatic powers gave him\n      the self-confidence and fearlessness necessary for bold spiritual\n      innovation. And there was a deeply emotional aspect to the Besht’s\n      personality. His feeling for common folk and identification with the\n      suffering of his fellow Jews, individually and collectively, spurred him\n      to utilize his charismatic powers for the benefit of his people.\n      The recent tendency in historiography has been to downplay the\n      narrative of crisis which earlier historians once used to help explain\n      Hasidism’s emergence. Current thinking emphasizes Polish Jewry’s\n      rather quick recovery from the Chmielnicki massacres, the robustnessReview\n      of its economic life, and even the relative security of its political\n      situation. While Etkes is surely aware of this trend, he reverts to the\n      earlier approach. Thus he writes that ‘‘The backdrop for the Besht’s\n      labors on behalf of the Jewish people was the bleak social and political\n      reality of Jewish life in the eighteenth century.’’ This included blood-\n      libels, Heidemak massacres, outbreaks of plague, economic upheavals,\n      the threat of the antinomian Frankists and even the burning of the\n      Talmud. (p. 110) Etkes’s renewed foregrounding of the dangers\n      besetting the community allows him to highlight the significance of\n      the Besht’s career, instilling hope and comfort and a sense that Jewish\n      interests were being championed and protected by a figure of true\n      stature and courage.\n      <br/><br/>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n      In returning to the emphasis on early Hasidism as a response to\n      crisis, Etkes’s presentation must be contrasted with another important\n      study of the Baal Shem Tov, Moshe Rosman’s Founder of Hasidism:\n      A Quest for the Historical Ba’al Shem Tov. 1 Based on breakthrough work\n      in Polish archives, Rosman asserts that the Jews of the Besht’s\n      geographic region ‘‘were suffering neither mass poverty nor mass\n      melancholia.’’ 2 And the Baal Shem Tov was not an outsider struggling\n      against ossified communal structures. As Rosman puts it, ‘‘the Besht\n      was much more a representative and perpetuator of existing religious,\n      social, political, and even economic realities than he was an innovator.\n      He certainly was no rebel against the establishment, whether religious\n      or social.’’ 3 Rosman is keen to show the Besht as ‘‘a person of\n      his time.’’\n      <br/><br/>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n      While Etkes agrees with much of this, he nevertheless portrays\n      the Besht in bolder strokes. He also has a more positive opinion of\n      the historicity of Shivhei Habesht, a collection of hagiographic tales\n      about the Baal Shem Tov and his circle, first published in 1814. In\n      contrast to Rosman’s skepticism, Etkes notes that details of these\n      stories have been corroborated in external sources. Although\n      published decades after the death of its subject, this collection\n      mentions episodes and facts that can now be verified by archival\n      discoveries; therefore, Etkes concludes, ‘‘many stories collected in the\n      book Shivhei Habesht reflect the genuine historical experiences of the\n      Besht and his associates.’’ (p. 223) And in contrast to some of his\n      fellow historians, Etkes does not dismiss the accounts of paranormal\n      phenomena out of hand. He writes, ‘‘it is not the historian’s business\n      to establish whether the Besht indeed was endowed with the powers\n      of prophecy and far-sightedness. What the historian is to do is to\n      determine whether these abilities of the Besht played a substantial part\n      in how he perceived himself, in how his associates viewed him, and\n      perforce also in the relations formed between him and those who\n      surrounded him.’’ (p. 223)232\n      <br/><br/>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"PDFTitle\">\n      Review\n      <br/><br/>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n      To augment his portrait, Etkes makes use of the published\n      homilies and sermons of the Besht’s disciples, notably the writings of\n      Rabbi Jacob Joseph of Polonne. Once again there is a contrast\n      between Etkes and Rosman, who asserts that ‘‘the possibility of\n      connecting with the Besht the sayings cited in the Besht’s name in\n      Jacob Joseph of Polonne’s books is very small.’’ 4 Etkes uses the teach-\n      ings of the Baal Shem Tov to construct a convincing intellectual\n      portrait of Hasidism’s founder, for example on the key topic of avodah\n      be-gashmiyyut, that is, robust affirmation of this physical world, with its\n      joys and pleasures, as a worthy vehicle for sacred service. His\n      willingness to use tales and teachings as well as archival materials\n      enables Etkes to triangulate his portrayal, each source serving to\n      enrich, complement and correct the others. What emerges is a three-\n      dimensional, multi-hued picture of a genuine illuminate. All this leads\n      to Etkes’s conclusion that Israel ben Eliezer was indeed the founder of\n      Hasidism, even though the rise of an organized movement took place\n      after his death. This is because the Besht’s charisma, paranormal\n      powers, teachings on ecstatic prayer and serving God with joy were\n      the centerpieces of the spiritual lives of his disciples such as Rabbi Dov\n      Ber the maggid of Mezerich, Rabbi Jacob Joseph of Polonne, and\n      other leaders of great stature. The early disciple circle cherished\n      their master’s life and teachings and lived their lives energized by the\n      inspiration of his person, and sought to share that inspiration with\n      others. So the question of whether ‘‘the Besht set in motion a process\n      that ultimately resulted in the launching of Hasidism as a movement’’\n      (p. 5) is answered in the affirmative.\n      <br/><br/>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n      Immanuel Etkes has set a solid and lasting foundation for further\n      work on the Baal Shem Tov and early Hasidism. One open line of\n      research is to continue the analysis of the Beshtian teachings as cited\n      in the writings of disciples, especially Rabbi Jacob Joseph of Polonne.\n      I believe that careful textual work can distinguish the teachings of the\n      Baal Shem Tov from that of his earnest follower. This is especially so\n      because the voices are so different. Rabbi Jacob Joseph was immensely\n      learned, and it shows on every page of his published works. But the\n      labyrinthine intricacy and dense complexity of his own teachings\n      contrast sharply with the lapidary brilliance of the Baal Shem Tov’s\n      insights. The Besht’s scriptural apercus arrive in a flash, capturing\n      the blaze of sacred words in stop-motion freeze-frame. Rabbi Jacob\n      Joseph actually did a good job of preserving his master’s aphoristic\n      style along with his mystical insights, and further research in this area\n      promises to be richly rewarding.\n      <br/><br/>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n      While the English translation of Etkes’s book, which originally\n      appeared in Hebrew, is generally clear and accurate, it tends to\n      stumble where the original quotes an earlier source, sometimes in233\n      <br/><br/>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"PDFTitle\">\n      Review\n      <br/><br/>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n      Aramaic. For example, the famous aphorism of Tikkunei Zohar, ‘‘Leyt\n      atar panui mineih,’’ is a main source for hasidic views on divine\n      immanence and omnipresence. The translation ‘‘no site is clear of\n      him’’ (p. 135 and elsewhere) betrays the influence of modern Hebrew\n      and misses the sense of the Zoharic Aramaic. And the prophet\n      Ezekiel’s chariot-vision has a phrase that became central in early\n      Hasidism, ve-ha-hayyot ratzo va-shov (Old JPS: ‘‘And the living creatures\n      ran and returned’’; Ez. 1:14). Early hasidic writers adopted a creative\n      misreading, as if the Hebrew was ve-ha-hiyyut ratzo va-shov, meaning,\n      ‘‘the spiritual vitality ran and returned.’’ This yields the idea that\n      ecstatic experiences could not endure constantly; their nature was to\n      ebb and flow.

Countering some\n          claims, the authors point out that Schneerson’s academic achievements\n          in Berlin were modest; although Friedrich Wilhelm University granted\n          him a certificate of attendance, he never advanced beyond the status\n          of auditor.<span className=\"SuperScript\">3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Later in Paris, he eventually did receive a degree, not\n          from the Sorbonne, but from a second-tier engineering school.

Distancing\n          themselves from the Jewish quarter and a small Hasidic synagogue,\n          they lived in a more avant-garde area, not far from Sartre and de\n          Beauvoir, Gertrude Stein and Alice B.

But how did an aspiring engineer\n          with a lackluster academic record and an uncertain connection to his\n          Hasidic heritage, a displaced refugee who had barely avoided the Nazi\n          vortex, make his way in a new country with an unfamiliar language\n          and culture, eventually to become the leader of a flourishing worldwide\n          religious movement? The answer according to Heilman and\n          Friedman is self-reinvention and shrewd manipulation: ‘‘From being\n          a somewhat mediocre mechanical and electrical engineer he would\n          become an outstanding social and spiritual engineer who would\n          offer his recipe for the redemption of the Jewish people.’’<span className=\"SuperScript\">6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\n          He ‘‘outflanked’’ his brother-in-law for the leadership,<span className=\"SuperScript\">7</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;and then ‘‘he had to\n          reinvent himself.

In Berlin he had lived, as they\n          put it, a ‘‘double life,’’<span className=\"SuperScript\">10</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;and while they note that his interest in\n          Hasidism began to grow during his last years in Europe, they portray\n          that interest as compelled by circumstance as much as by inner desire:\n          ‘‘Clearly, as his prospects for a career as an engineer declined,\n          Mendel’s possibilities for and interest in a vocation in the court of\n          ChaBaD grew. This, he surely recognized by the end of the 1930s, was\n          something he could do.’’<span className=\"SuperScript\">11</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\n          And after the war, ‘‘ he would become a renewed almost reborn person in America [emphasis in original]; he\n          would no longer be Mendel Schneerson, would-be French engineer\n          and student. As we have seen, by 1951 he would be reinvented and\n          remade. No longer the shy introvert, he became the self-confident\n          extrovert and leader, emerging as Grand Rabbi Menachem Mendel\n          Schneerson, shlita . . . , the seventh Lubavitcher rebbe.’’<span className=\"SuperScript\">12</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          Is this plausible, a mountebank as Hasidic master? Turning oneself\n          into a rebbe by effort of will and trompe l’oeil? With the omniscient\n          voice of a biblical narrator, Heilman and Friedman presume access to\n          Schneerson’s inner motivations, framed in flat and pedestrian terms.\n          They write as if Schneerson’s emergence as Hasidic leader was a makeover\n          engineered by a career counselor. Why would anyone go along\n          with such posturing, agreeing to see a minor engineer-turned-rebbe in\n          the dead of night? It is here that Heilman’s and Friedman’s project\n          runs aground: the first part of their book is so intent on deflating\n          Schneerson’s aggrandized image, bringing him down to earth, that\n          one is at a loss to understand how his followers were inspired to\n          spread his message to every corner of the earth.\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          It is even harder to see how he could have left a powerful impression\n          on movement outsiders who were not sympathetic to the messianism\n          and who were likely dismissive or even actively hostile to it. For\n          such is the case. In his memoir All Rivers Run to the Sea,<span className=\"SuperScript\">13</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Elie Wiesel\n          writes of the influence of Rabbi Menahem Mendel Schneerson on his\n          life and work. He tells of a visit to Lubavitch (i.e., to 770 Eastern\n          Parkway in Brooklyn) one year during the holiday of Simchat Torah.\n          The vignette of their encounter is richly drawn, conveying deep\n          mutual affection and respect. At the end of their dialogue the\n          Rebbe says, ‘‘You deserve a blessing. Name it!’’ Wiesel hesitates and\n          the Rebbe continues, ‘‘Would you like me to bless you so you can\n          begin again?’’ Wiesel was struck by the Rebbe’s wisdom, since ‘‘[t]o\n          begin again could mean so many things: begin again to drink, to pray,\n          to believe, to live. And then it was Simchat Torah, which is also my\n          birthday.’’\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          This episode affected Wiesel deeply. He presents the exchange as\n          unplanned, spontaneous. The multivalent suppleness and playful\n          capaciousness of the Rebbe’s blessing, all delivered on the spur of the\n          moment, disclosed penetrating discernment, and fresh possibility.\n          Did the Rebbe know that Simchat Torah is Wiesel’s birthday? Was it\n          sheer luck, a stab in the dark, or prodigious memory of prior meetings\n          summoned and applied in a flash? The Simchat Torah gathering was\n          dominated by a mood of buoyant festivity, but elsewhere Wiesel writes\n          of other meetings when the subject of the Holocaust came up. Wiesel\n          states that his dialogue with the Rebbe on that topic ‘‘was a turning\n          point in my writing.’’<span className=\"SuperScript\">14</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Wiesel did not become a Lubavitcher, but that\n          is just the point: Schneerson’s ability to touch souls was not limited to\n          movement insiders, to those in thrall to his image and mystique.\n          Encounters similar to the ones with Wiesel took place all the time,\n          day after day, for decades.

As Clifford Geertz notes with dismay in\n          an essay titled, ‘‘Centers, Kings, and Charisma: Reflections on the\n          Symbolics of Power,’’ in our day, a politician or a rock star may be\n          called charismatic, ‘‘mainly on the grounds that he has contrived to\n          interest a certain number of people in the glitter of his personality.’’<span className=\"SuperScript\">26</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\n          But it is precisely a quality of the numinous, not contrivance or self-presentation, that so many discerning people found in Schneerson\n          and that served to propel his influence. Jonathan Sacks is at pains to\n          point out that what one felt in the presence of Soloveitchik and\n          Schneersohn was not a simulacrum of ‘‘charisma’’; rather one sensed\n          ‘‘a kind of humility. In their presence you could feel the divine presence.’’ ‘‘Both conveyed the gravitas and depth of the Jewish soul.’’\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n          Shmuel N. Eisenstadt writes in his introduction to Weber’s On\n          Charisma and Institution Building that charismatic fervor ‘‘is rooted in\n          the attempt to come into contact with the very essence of being, to go\n          to the very roots of existence, of cosmic, social, and cultural order, to\n          what is seen as sacred and fundamental.’’<span className=\"SuperScript\">27</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Eisenstadt quotes at length\n          from Edward A. Shils, who notes that charisma depends on being\n          perceived as being closely connected to some central feature of the\n          cosmos and its power. Shils remarks that charisma may be attained\n          through ‘‘reflective wisdom,’’ and that even those who do not possess\n          it nevertheless may appreciate it and feel the need for proximity to\n          those who more fully inhabit the cosmic center, since ‘‘their own\n          weaker responsiveness is fortified and heightened’’ thereby.<span className=\"SuperScript\">28</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          For Rabbinic Judaism in general and Habad Hasidism in particular, the cosmic center and source of power is knowledge of Torah in\n          all its aspects. Drawing on Eisenstadt’s work, the Israeli sociologist\n          Aryei Fishman notes the charismatic power of Torah in Jewish religious life, and observes that Torah can be ‘‘the source of order and\n          authority when a religious order breaks down,’’<span className=\"SuperScript\">29</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;that is,\n          when conventional religiosity proves inadequate for a new situation. Thus,\n          ‘‘religious consciousness—the consciousness that perceives itself as\n          knowing the will of God—can view Torah as charisma either\n          innovatively or conservatively.’’<span className=\"SuperScript\">30</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;And as Shaul Stampfer writes, ‘‘The very\n          possession of talmudic knowledge gave the scholar charisma and this\n          was irrespective of more conventional sources of charisma, such as\n          appearance, bearing, or personality.’’<span className=\"SuperScript\">31</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Stampfer observes that this\n          ‘‘charisma of knowledge’’ is enhanced by wide exposure to challenging\n          classical texts, since it is firsthand knowledge of the difficulties that\n          increases the prestige of those few who excel.<span className=\"SuperScript\">32</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          Schneerson’s charisma was grounded in his commanding knowledge of the rabbinic canon, including Talmud, Midrash, Maimonides’\n          Mishneh Torah, as well as Zohar and the voluminous theoretical treatises of Habad Hasidism; all of this in on display in the thirty-nine\n          collected volumes of Sichos, extended expositions on exoteric themes,\n          as well as the more esoteric Ma’amarim, which take up and develop\n          aspects of the abstract and enigmatically paradoxical Habad\n          theology.<span className=\"SuperScript\">33</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          Stampfer has pointed out that, ‘‘[i]n east European Jewish society\n          it was possible, though not common, for a scholar to study in isolation\n          until he was ready to make his mark on the scholarly world.’’<span className=\"SuperScript\">34</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Stampfer cites the case of\n          Naftali Tsevi Berlin (1817–93), who ‘‘transformed himself into a major scholar known particularly for the broad\n          scope of his knowledge,’’ as a result of a lengthy period of\n          sequestration in private study. Another example, not mentioned by Stampfer,\n          is Avraham Yesha’ayahu Karelitz, known as the ‘‘Hazon Ish’’ (1878–\n          1953). The excellent biography of Karelitz by Benjamin Brown points\n          out that the young Karelitz studied essentially by himself and was\n          almost completely unknown before his immigration to the Land of\n          Israel at the age of fifty five.<span className=\"SuperScript\">35</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Heilman and Friedman entirely miss\n          the context, the much broader phenomenon of young prodigies from\n          prominent rabbinic families in Eastern Europe going to Berlin and\n          working to integrate Western learning with their own heritage. Hillel\n          Goldberg’s Between Berlin and Slobodka<span className=\"SuperScript\">36</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;follows the transitions made\n          by Isaac Hutner, Joseph B. Soloveitchik, and Abraham Joshua Heschel,\n          among others. Soloveitchik had studied Rabbinics privately with his\n          father for twelve years, learning the characteristic conceptual approach\n          to Talmud study of his grandfather, Rabbi Hayyim Soloveitchik.\n          Goldberg points out that ‘‘[p]rior to university, then, Joseph Baer\n          Soloveitchik never went to school.’’\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          More recently, we have the biography of Heschel by Edward\n          Kaplan and Samuel Dresner,<span className=\"SuperScript\">37</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;which amply demonstrates that a\n          young scion from a great Hasidic family can be profoundly attracted\n          to Western learning and culture while maintaining an intense and\n          abiding commitment to Hasidism. As Kaplan writes in a summary\n          statement of powerful concision, Heschel was a ‘‘university-educated\n          East European Jew inspired by God.’’<span className=\"SuperScript\">38</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;For all the differences between\n          Heschel and Schneerson, precisely the same statement should be\n          made about Schneerson; and one wishes that Heilman andFriedman had done so.\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          During the Berlin and Paris years Schneerson indeed kept himself\n          in seclusion, but this isolation permitted intense inner work. To be\n          sure, there are dangers when religious formation takes place without\n          much peer contact, but the examples of Soloveitchik, Karelitz, and\n          Heschel, among others, demonstrate that some extraordinary religious\n          personalities are able to flourish and reach full stature outside the\n          conformity and regimentation of the yeshiva world. As Brown makes\n          clear in his study of Karelitz, the long period of self-sequestration and\n          focused study was fueled not only by prodigious intellect, depth of\n          spirit, and infinite capacity for conceptual labor but also by a clarity of\n          purpose and sharply defined sense of self that sustained and refreshed\n          a horizon of aspiration for decades. In the secular world, one can\n          think of the analogy of famous technology visionaries who quit college\n          to work in a garage, eventually emerging with creative concepts and\n          products that transformed the world. Rather than seeing Schneerson’s\n          relative isolation as indifference to Hasidic culture, it was more likely a\n          decision to develop away from the distractions and conformity of the\n          Hasidic community itself. The Schneersons saw themselves as nobility,\n          indeed, the spiritual aristocracy of the Jewish world. As with most\n          aristocracies, there is not only noblesse oblige and communal concern\n          but also patrician reserve and a carefully calibrated distance. At a\n          point in their lives when they were not ready to take on a more\n          public role, the young couple may have chosen to live away from\n          the main Jewish area precisely to ensure that they would not be\n          pestered by overly enthusiastic, curious Hasidim.\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          The rules are indeed different for royalty, and most commoners\n          have no problem with that fact. The average Hasid living in poverty\n          did not resent the holidays in Marienbad their rebbes took with their\n          families and entourage; on the contrary, they found self-esteem in the\n          royal treatment their master received and took vicarious pleasure in\n          the trips. As David Assaf notes in his study of Rabbi Israel of Ruzhin,\n          Ruzhin Hasidim took pride in their rebbe’s regal lifestyle, which, it was\n          said, he adopted for reasons of state and in which he took no personal\n          pleasure; as Assaf puts it, ‘‘his conventions of nobility and kingliness\n          were accepted by his hasidim and viewed with affection.’’<span className=\"SuperScript\">39</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          Heilman and Friedman occasionally mention reports of\n          Schneerson’s grasp of Habad teachings but these remain vague and\n          muffled, and the authors never adequately address Schneerson’s rabbinic mastery. The silence on the key matter of scholarship skews their\n          entire effort. In the fall of 1964, Schneerson began a multiyear series\n          of discourses, known as sichos, explicating Rashi’s commentary on\n          Torah, developing and applying a consistent set of rules and interpretive practices. The Rashi sichos, which number in the hundreds,\n          constitute an impressive analytical corpus on the great medieval commentator.\n          The sichos trace Rashi’s sources in Talmud and Midrash,\n          noting how Rashi shapes and molds his materials for his purposes.\n          They draw upon the rich library of Rashi supercommentaries and\n          arrive at original conclusions regarding Rashi’s meaning and intent.\n          Each Rashi sichah is a tour de force of learned exposition. To be sure,\n          Schneerson’s exegetical principles would be unlikely to find acceptance\n          in the academy. For example, he posited that Rashi’s words\n          always convey meaning accessible to a five-year-old child and at the\n          same time encode a deep esoteric layer.<span className=\"SuperScript\">40</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet in their richness, scope,\n          sustained creativity, and vigor, they are a remarkable body of work.\n          And—unusual for these circles—Rabbi Schneerson consulted and deployed\n          variant readings based on manuscripts available to him.<span className=\"SuperScript\">41</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          The rabbi’s sustained focus on Rashi would have provided fertile\n          grounds for analysis had Heilman and Friedman taken note of it. For,\n          as Avraham Grossman observed in his seminal study of Rashi, key\n          elements of Rashi’s worldview included the uniqueness of the Jewish\n          people, a special loving regard for the sanctity of the Land of Israel,\n          and poignant messianic longing.<span className=\"SuperScript\">42</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Precisely these elements figure\n          prominently in Schneerson’s own thinking. Had they been attentive\n          to Schneerson’s scholarly output, they might have traced the antecedents\n          of his characteristic ideas in illuminating ways.\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n          The authors would have done well to spend time with Kaplan’s\n          excellent study of Heschel, which evokes the atmosphere of spiritual\n          nobility in Hasidic aristocratic families, with homes centered on religious aspiration and spiritual quest. In such homes, every religious act\n          was to be performed with mindfulness and a sublime aesthetic, making\n          a personal statement of sacredness and reverence that reflected the\n          family’s religious signature.\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n          In Schneerson’s case, a strong indication of this culture is to be\n          found in the Reshimos, notebooks from the 1920s and 1930s. Heilman\n          and Friedman do mention the notebooks but do not fully grasp their\n          significance. Not diaries, the Reshimos actually reflect the inner practices of the Chabad elite and young Schneerson’s faithful recording of\n          everything he saw and heard of these practices, largely from his father-in-law, signaling his induction into the Chabad leadership circle. As a\n          Schneerson, part of the extended cousinage comprising the descendents of the founders, he was already eligible to join, but now he\n          received transmission of practices that were not well known or deliberately kept from public view, making him a true member of Chabad’s\n          spiritual elite. And his faithful and lovingly meticulous recording of\n          the practices, vignettes, and stories, reflects his desire to internalize\n          that elite status, to inhabit it from within. The possibility that the\n          young scion of the Schneerson lineage may have had a rich interior\n          spiritual life even while pursuing his engineering degree, and that his\n          leadership abilities may have grown from the seedbed of that life, is\n          not considered by our authors.\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n          Rabbi Schneerson’s detractors have taken to calling him a ‘‘failed\n          messiah.’’ This recalls something Alex Ross wrote about Leonard\n          Bernstein. In his acclaimed survey of twentieth-century music\n          The Rest is Noise, Ross notes that some critics claim that Bernstein\n          ‘‘frittered away his gift amid glitzy conducting dates, media appearances,\n          and ‘radical chic’ parties at his apartment in Manhattan.’’ To\n          this Ross responds, ‘‘Yet Bernstein’s failures outweighed many others’\n          successes.’’<span className=\"SuperScript\">43</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mutatis mutandis, Schneerson’s failure, if such it is,\n          outshines the paltry success of so many other erstwhile Jewish leaders.\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          This book is helpful as an account of the transformation of\n          Chabad from inner-directed to outer-facing, from a lineage that\n          prized lengthy contemplative prayer to one that celebrates bold feats\n          of outreach. But the biography of Rabbi Menachem Mendel\n          Schneerson, when it is written, must not omit his command of the\n          entire textual corpus of Rabbinic Judaism; his mastery and creative\n          deployment of the paradoxical, intricate, and labyrinthine Chabad\n          theological system; administrative proficiency that apparently included\n          near-total recall of names, faces, and relevant facts; manifest spiritual\n          intensity and boundless energy, displayed in the orchestration of collective rites of numinous transmission; the ability to listen deeply,\n          counsel wisely, bring out the best in interlocutors, outsiders as well\n          as devotees; and passionate concern for the destiny of the Jewish\n          people as he understood it.\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n          Some might take this as a retrograde lapse into hagiography.\n          Quite the opposite: as Orwell suggested, one’s analytical tools must\n          be adequate to the subject at hand. With an individual like Menachem\n          Mendel Schneerson, a pinched and blinkered approach simply will not\n          work, not even as social history. What is most important must not be\n          left off the table. The biographer must not confuse inspirational leadership\n          with careerism. A hermeneutic of suspicion is called for, but\n          one must know of what to be suspicious. For Rabbi Menachem\n          Mendel Schneerson, crass ambition and intellectual shallowness are\n          not on the list. Only a robust portrait that takes seriously the imaginative\n          reach of a great thinker can capture both the possibilities and\n          perils of religious leadership. It is not blind piety but the discipline of\n          sociology that requires a serious engagement with religious intensity\n          and its numinous origins.\n          <br/><br/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n          BOSTON HEBREW COLLEGE\n          Advance Access publication December 23, 2013\n          </div>\n          </div>);\n   }\n}\n\nexport default Reviewoftherebbethelifea;\n","import React from 'react';\n\nclass Charismaticleadercharism extends React.Component {\n    // console.log(this);\n    render()\n    {\n        return (<div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBodyTitle\">\n            Charismatic Leader,\n            Charismatic Book:\n            Rabbi Shneur Zalman’s Tanya and His Leadership\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n            Rabbi Shneur Zalman’s Tanya has become an iconic book, published\n            in facsimile editions in towns and cities all over the world as an act\n            of piety and talismanic protection.

In this second phase, which emerged after 1772, the movement\n            was organized around masters, or tzaddikim, each of whom\n            held sway in a relatively well defined geographical area, enjoying\n            the allegiance and veneration of passionate followers, known as hassidim.\n            <span className=\"SuperScript\">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Each tzaddik was known for a certain style of teaching and\n            sacred service, whose elements formed a unique spiritual signature.\n            It is around this time that we see the emergence of Hassidic courts,\n            supported by donations from followers.

In its\n            self-confidence and self-assurance of total coverage of a domain of\n            analysis, this foreword is reminiscent of Maimonides’ introduction\n            to the Mishneh Torah, with the added feature that the author an-\n            nounces his intention that any questions about the advice in Tanya\n            be referred to a network of disciples who will explicate its teaching.\n            In this way, the book would serve as a resource that would largely\n            replace person-to-person contact with the master, since “time no\n            longer permits of replying to everyone individually and in detail on\n            his particular problem.”\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n            The foreword does not tell us what questions Rabbi Shneur\n            Zalman’s hassidim addressed to him, but to judge by Tanya itself,\n            they apparently were prompted by the gradual erosion of the illu-\n            mination that had characterized Hassidism’s earliest period, when\n            religious exuberance reigned by virtue of partaking in a new and\n            vital religious dispensation<span className=\"SuperScript\">6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;During the formative years, religious\n            devotion seemed to come effortlessly and without resistance, in an\n            intense glow of new discovery and excitement. By the 1790s, as the\n            movement spread and the number of followers increased dramati-\n            cally, routinization had set in, with all its vexing obstacles to the re-\n            ligious life. In early Hassidism it had seemed as if human nature had\n            been born again; its motto could have been (to borrow from William\n            Wordsworth) “Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive, / But to be young\n\n            was very heaven!” By the 1790s, however, despite (or perhaps because\n            of) the geographic spread and numerical growth of the movement,\n            the glow and buoyancy of the early days were receding. It was this\n            that impelled large numbers of Rabbi Shneur Zalman’s followers\n            to seek out their master, to express their puzzlement at the gradual\n            attenuation of exuberant spirituality, and to register their dismay at\n            the return of the daily struggle with temptation.\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n            The structure of Tanya deserves some comment. The book\n            begins with a presentation of several early rabbinic texts, whose\n            juxtaposition reveals (in good pilpulistic fashion) an apparent con-\n            tradiction. In order to resolve the contradiction, the author proceeds\n            to reconfigure the standard moral categorization of tzaddik and\n            rasha (“righteous” and “wicked”), terms that go back to the Bible. By\n            the time he has finished his exegetical reshaping, the entire moral\n            landscape has changed; the spiritual topography has shifted, and no\n            boundary marker has been left untouched. It takes fourteen chapters\n            for this seismic shift to work itself out, and when it does, the aver-\n            age reader might be forgiven if he forgets the questions that had\n            launched the exploration back in Chapter 1. But the author has not:\n            he returns to the issues he raised fourteen chapters before and, by\n            his lights, resolves them decisively. Ancillary questions are treated\n            in the following chapters until the Sefer Shel Beinonim, or “Book of\n            Intermediate Individuals,” Tanya’s first section, concludes. The entire\n            effect is one of total mastery, total control; the reader feels he has\n            been led lovingly, knowingly, firmly through a transformative jour-\n            ney by a leader who foresaw the outcome with total clarity from the\n            outset. This is a tour de force that compels the reader by the power of\n            argument, but even more by the power of the mind, which advances\n            it<span className=\"SuperScript\">7</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;One is hard pressed to think of another Hassidic work anywhere\n            that presents such a sustained, cogently set out argument as Sefer Shel\n            Beinonim, with its long development arch cresting to a conclusion\n            that is both triumphant and inevitable. Since its appearance, readers\n            from all camps Hassidic, maskilic, and academic have expressed\n            admiration for the style of Tanya no less than its substance.\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n            It is hardly an accident that Tanya begins with a Talmudic\n            passage on the administration of an oath. According to a beraita\n            cited in Niddah 30b, every individual is given an oath before birth,\n            adjuring him to “be righteous and not wicked; and even if the whole\n            world tells you that you are righteous, regard yourself as if you were\n            wicked.” The fact that the author chooses this passage to open his\n            work makes clear that his essential theme is duty, the obligation of\n            the individual to fulfill his responsibility. The hassid is enjoined to\n            act as a tzaddik acts that is, with perfect rectitude, in complete con-\n            formity with the dictates of the Torah and the 613 commandments.\n            He may be mistaken by others for a tzaddik, a Hassidic saint, but\n            inside he knows that he still struggles with temptation; hence the\n            need for the oath, suggesting resolute commitment and unwavering\n            attentiveness. The fact that the individual is under oath raises the\n            stakes of the religious life, in that failure or even a simple misstep\n            is not simply wrong, but is a violation of a solemn pledge. And the\n            fact that an oath is required underscores the reality that the average\n            person is in constant danger of succumbing to temptation and needs\n            the oath to bind him to his mission.\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n            The question arises, Of all the topics in the religious life in\n            general and Hassidism in particular, why did Rabbi Shneur Zalman\n            consider the redefinition of tzaddik/rasha to be of such crucial im-\n            portance as to devote his seminal work on Hassidism, the only one\n            to be published in his lifetime, to it? Why the need to develop and\n            amplify the category of beinoni (a term that does not appear in the\n            Bible and does not play a central role in most Talmudic presenta-\n            tions of religious typology) to such a degree? And why the need to\n            make the category of tzaddik virtually impossible to attain? Before\n            Tanya, the tzaddik was commonly understood to be an individual\n            in whom virtue dominates over vice, whose good deeds outweigh\n            his sins. But for Tanya, to have any sins at all consigns one to the\n            category of rasha, wicked. To be a tzaddik, one must not only be free\n            of sin, but free of any temptation to sin, to be so bathed in divine\n            grace and light that one is drawn unceasingly to the good. Tanya\n            explicitly teaches that the category of tzaddik is virtually unattain-\n            able by one’s own effort<span className=\"SuperScript\">8</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n            The answer to these questions appears to be that the primary\n            goal of Tanya is to explain to the devotee that he is not a tzaddik and\n\n            should surrender hopes of becoming one. The stratification of the\n            Hassidic world and the emergence of a clear hierarchy, which were\n            ongoing at this time, were given a powerful justification by the ap-\n            pearance of Tanya. The category of beinoni is completely revised. No\n            longer is the beinoni a person whose virtues and demerits are roughly\n            in balance. Rather, the beinoni is a person who knows temptation\n            but never succumbs to it. The beinoni is thus in constant struggle,\n            and that is a good thing, for God delights in the victory of good over\n            evil, and merit accrues to the individual from his unceasing victory\n            over baser urges<span className=\"SuperScript\">9</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n            Images of struggle and conquest occur frequently in Tanya. The\n            hassid is a warrior in constant battle against the evil inclination<span className=\"SuperScript\">10</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;The body is called a “small city,” over which the divine soul and the\n            animal soul fight. To be sure, there are respite moments, when, in\n            an intense effort of concentration, the beinoni cultivates a state of\n            God-consciousness, but these are achieved during recitation of the\n            Shema and the Amidah, after which the essence of the animal soul\n            and its propensities returns. The respite moments serve to maximize\n            the spiritual possibilities available to the beinoni, while at the same\n            time they keep the distinction between the beinoni and the tzaddik\n            sharp and clear, since only for the tzaddik is the suffusion of being\n            with God-consciousness permanent and unceasing.\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n            In this way, Tanya is carefully crafted to exploit the tension\n            between control and empowerment. The book makes it clear that\n            the tzaddik is a different order of being than the hassid. Maximalist\n            demands are placed upon the beinoni/hassid, who is expected to\n            behave in thought, word, and deed like a tzaddik, but who yet is\n            told that there is little if any possibility that he might ever become a\n            tzaddik. This framework empowers the hassid to become a warrior\n            for Hassidism, but essentially precludes any aspiration on the part\n            of the hassid to become a leader himself.\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n            The reconfiguration of the meaning of tzaddik / beinoni / rasha\n            that Tanya effects, creates a new spiritual landscape, one unlike what\n            is found in the writings of contemporary Hassidic masters. For Rabbi\n            Shneur Zalman, the tzaddik is another order of existence, absolutely\n            separated by nature from the average individual. This spiritual\n            topography is not to be found in the writings of R. Levi Yitzhak of\n            Berditchev, for example, where there is no indication that the tzaddik\n            is set off metaphysically from the average individual. Even a work\n            like R. Elimelekh of Lyzhansk’s Noam Elimelekh, with its powerful\n            presentation of the role of the tzaddik, makes it clear that the tzaddik\n            is not beyond struggle<span className=\"SuperScript\">11</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n            Rabbi Shneur Zalman’s desire to distinguish the tzaddik from\n            the beinoni, whose destiny is perpetual struggle, is so strong, that\n            he asserts that a key passage in the Shema, “that you seek not after\n            your own heart and your own eyes, after which you go astray,” <span className=\"SuperScript\">12</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;does\n            not refer to the tzaddik. Rabbinic tradition understands this verse\n            as an admonition to resist the temptations of heresy and sexual sin.\n            But since the tzaddik has no temptation at all, this verse cannot refer\n            to him<span className=\"SuperScript\">13</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n            The message of Tanya is sober yet reassuring: the initial era of\n            Hassidism, the era of boundless illumination and spiritual exuber-\n            ance, is over. The animal nature has reasserted itself, as we should\n            have known it would, but there is essential, valuable work to do. That\n            work can be done as long as the hassid remains faithful to his task\n            and condition as beinoni, faithful to the oath he took before he was\n            born. In sum, we are arguing that Tanya must be understood as a\n            period piece, a response to a movement’s transition from youth to\n            maturity. Rabbi Shneur Zalman wrote a book that would make clear\n            the division of labor that would prevail in Hassidism’s mature phase,\n            defining and patrolling its internal boundaries.\n            Part ii of Likkutei Amarim–Tanya, called Shaar ha-Yihud ve-ha-\n            Emunah (“The Gate of Unity and Faith”), is a clear exposition of early\n            Hassidism’s acosmic theology<span className=\"SuperScript\">14</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;As Naftali Loewenthal and others\n            have pointed out, Rabbi Shneur Zalman’s original intention was\n            apparently to place Shaar ha-Yihud ve-ha-Emunah before Part i, an\n            arrangement that would have given further emphasis to the acosmic\n            view. As we have it, Tanya’s main thrust lies more with the struggle\n            and conquest of Part i than with the vision of unity of Part ii<span className=\"SuperScript\">15</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;As it\n            stands, Part ii serves to buttress the Sefer Shel Beinonim, reminding\n            the hassid that God is everywhere, thus emboldening him to act with\n            courage and confidence in every circumstance and location. The\n\n            total effect is not one of mystical ecstasy, but motivation to action.<span className=\"SuperScript\">16</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;The potent rhetorical strategy of Tanya, simultaneously augmenting\n            the poles of control and empowerment, coupled with the mystical\n            theology of God-in-all-places and God-in-all things (but downplay-\n            ing ecstatic illumination) provokes the reader into action and fosters\n            a posture of fearlessness and militancy.\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n            The appearance of Tanya evoked comments from other leaders\n            in the world of Hassidism, notably R. Avraham Kalisker, who wrote\n            a sharply critical letter to Rabbi Shneur Zalman in 1797, shortly after\n            the appearance of Tanya.<span className=\"SuperScript\">17</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I must respectfully differ from the\n            approach of Naftali Loewenthal in his Communicating the Infinite.<span className=\"SuperScript\">18</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;In Loewenthal’s view, the essential innovation of Rabbi Shneur Zal-\n            man is his development of a systematic method of presentation of\n            esoteric ideas. Loewenthal writes that “R. Avraham Kalisker criti-\n            cized the idea of making esoteric teachings available to the ordinary\n            members of the Hassidic fraternity.... In R. Avraham’s view the at-\n            tempt manifested by the Tanya methodically to communicate these\n            teachings was dangerous.”\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n            I would present R. Avraham’s objections a bit differently. The\n            project of Tanya was dangerous because it was a retrograde move-\n            ment from the teachings of the Besht and the Maggid, as R. Avraham\n            saw them. In his view, the words of the Maggid were moments of\n            illumination, epiphanies that could not be encased in a structure of\n            systematic thought without doing violence to their essential char-\n            acter. For R. Avraham Kalisker, the concern is not so much with the\n            promulgation of esoteric teachings, but rather with the assumption\n            that such promulgation is possible.\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n            In the view of R. Avraham, the communal structure that Tanya\n            fostered was problematic in two respects: in its aspect of control,\n            and in its aspect of empowerment. In the aspect of empowerment,\n            it enabled an ever-widening circle of followers of uncertain spiritual\n            attainments to believe they could be teachers and transmitters of\n            authentic Hassidic teachings. For R. Avraham, only someone who\n            had already attained a sublime spiritual state could be safely empow-\n            ered to promulgate the teachings. On the other hand, at the pole of\n            control, R. Avraham’s view was that here Rabbi Shneur Zalman had\n            narrowed the domain of the tzaddik nearly to the vanishing point it\n            was a set that appeared to have room only for a single exemplar. Here\n            we must recall R. Avraham’s emphasis on dibbuk haveirim, where a\n            small circle of initiates shares spiritual insights with one other, and\n            help one another along the path, but with little or no emphasis on\n            the role of a tzaddik as a singular figure.19\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n            For R. Avraham Kalisker, then, the pole of empowerment in\n            Tanya spread the dimensions of the circle much too broadly, while\n            the emphasis on control restricted the inner circle much too nar-\n            rowly. R. Avraham Kalisker’s vision of the Hassidic community was\n            much smaller than that of Rabbi Shneur Zalman’s, but it was a vision\n            of community without walls, without formal structure, without (in\n            his view) unnecessary theoretical scaffolding, without rigid demar-\n            cation lines and that did not a priori exclude anyone from joining\n            its most inner circle. Kalisker’s opposition to Tanya was not a reflex\n            reaction to the promulgation of esoterica, but a principled affirma-\n            tion of what he saw as the essential contribution of the Hassidism of\n            his teachers to Jewish spirituality, and which was in danger of being\n            eroded by a theoretical systemization that paralleled the imposition\n            of a stratified and regimented social structure.\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n            Ha-sayyif ve-ha-sefer yardu kerukhim min ha-shamayyim, “the\n            sword and the book came down together from heaven.”20 In the\n            case of Tanya, the book was a sword; a powerful weapon that every\n            individual hassid could wield against his own animal nature and\n            employ to great effect in the task of moral and spiritual growth.\n            Tanya also was and is a potent weapon that the Chabad movement\n            could employ to overcome opposition within the world of Has-\n            sidism, on the part of the Mitnagdim, the capricious turns of tsarist\n            policy, the winds of Haskalah, secularism and modernity, as well as\n            the cruel, relentless, and naked power of the Stalinist Soviet regime.\n            Of all the Jewish traditional movements and institutions in tsarist\n            Russia and the Leninist-Stalinist onslaught that followed, Chabad\n            Hassidism was arguably the one that stood up best to the terrors,\n            holding ground where it seemed impossible to do so. And in the\n            much more benign times of the post–World War II period, Chabad\n            has grasped the opportunities for external growth and expansion,\n\n            creating a network of outposts staffed by devotees who subordinate\n            their personal comfort and even their spiritual growth in favor of\n            the urgent needs of the movement.\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n            As the foundational work of this religious movement, Tanya\n            achieved enormous success and has been of inestimable influence.\n            It must be recalled, however, that the initial purpose of Tanya was\n            not the promulgation of mystical doctrines, much less the teach-\n            ing of mystical techniques or practices, but the stratification and\n            regimentation of the Hassidic community and the assignment of\n            appropriate roles. The strictures of R. Avraham Kalisker might\n            alert us to possibility that Tanya’s success may have been achieved\n            at some cost to the original vision of Hassidism, and that both the\n            control and the empowerment may not be entirely consistent with\n            the social vision and unstructured illuminations of the movement’s\n            earliest leaders.\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBodyTitle PDFBodyFN\">\n            Notes\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBodyFN\">\n            1.\n            See Ada Rapoport-Albert, “Hassidism after 1772: Structural Continuity and Change,”\n            in Hassidism Reappraised, ed.

Rabbi Israel Hapstein (1737–1814), the Maggid of Kozienice, was one of the found-\n            ers of Hassidism in Poland. He writes that he once saw the Baal Shem Tov in a\n            dream and asked him why “when I began my service [in Hassidism] and entered\n            the circle of tzaddikim to learn from their deeds...I felt a daily change for the good\n            in my Torah study and prayer...but now I feel no change. It seems that each day\n            is like the day before and the day after.” See Sefer Avodat Yisrael, Parashat Shemini,\n            end. This description of personal experience, when projected onto the movement\n            as a whole, does much to explain the structural transformations of this period, to\n            which Tanya was one response.\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBodyFN\">\n            7.

The older philosophical style, which Nozick calls “coercive philosophy,”\n            tries to force assent to its conclusions by the power of its arguments. This stands\n            in contrast to Nozick’s approach, which explains how certain beliefs and views are\n            possible but without attempting to coerce, retaining wonder and puzzlement.\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBodyFN\">\n            8.

Fine writes that ibbur “occurs for a temporary period of\n            time, until the impregnated soul accomplishes its goal.” If so, the ontological divide\n            between tzaddik and beinoni in Tanya’s system is not really breached.\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBodyFN\">\n            9.

Her views have been criticized by Isaiah\n            Tishby and Joseph Dan, who argue that the teachings of Tanya are exoteric, while\n            Rabbi Shneur Zalman’s esoteric theology is to be found in such works as Torah Or\n            (Kopys, 1837) and Likkutei Torah (Zhitomir, 1848). (The views of Tishby and Dan\n            were published in their essay on Hassidism in the Hebrew Encyclopedia, 17:775).\n            Be that as it may, it remains true that Tanya was the only work of Hassidic teach-\n            ings by Rabbi Shneur Zalman published in his lifetime. He clearly had an intense\n            interest in the appearance of the work, and the publication project was under his\n            direct supervision. Thus Tanya remains the only official, authorized text of Chabad\n            Hassidism as a movement, as envisioned by the movement’s founder.\n            See Naftali Loewenthal, “The Apotheosis of Action in Early Chabad,” Da’at 18 (1987);\n            see also Arthur Green, “Hassidism: Discovery and Retreat,” in The Other Side of\n            God, ed.

Yet while the theology of the tsaddik and\n            his role are discussed at length in Hasidic theoretical literature, the\n            dynastic principle is seldom discussed—or even mentioned—in Hasidic\n            derashot (sermons, or discourses). Similarly, while the emergence of the\n            Hasidic dynasties has been duly noted in scholarly studies, the reasons\n            for that emergence have never been fully explained. In a recently repub-\n            lished group of essays, Joseph Dan has underscored the centrality of the\n            institution of the tsaddik for understanding Hasidism; according to\n            Dan, it is the only really new feature of the movement as a whole.<span className=\"SuperScript\">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n            After the first few decades of the movement’s existence, the tsaddik’s\n            charismatic leadership became hereditary, so that “the tzaddik is a mira-\n            cle worker both because of his charismatic relationship with the divine\n            world and because of his being a descendant of great magicians like the\n            Besht or the Maggid.”<span className=\"SuperScript\">2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually, the charismatic element dwindled,\n            and entitlement to leadership became “genetic, rather than an intellec-\n            tual or spiritual.”<span className=\"SuperScript\">3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dan characterizes hereditary leadership as “legitimate,\n            organic, and central”<span className=\"SuperScript\">4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;to the movement, yet he cannot entirely hide his\n\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n            puzzlement with this “stupendous phenomenon,”<span className=\"SuperScript\">5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;which “introduced\n            into Jewish culture the oxymoron of a hereditary charismatic leader and\n            miracle worker.”<span className=\"SuperScript\">6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dan argues persuasively that the main factor securing\n            the miraculous contemporary rebirth of Hasidic communities in the\n            aftermath of the Holocaust and other recent crises was “adherence to\n            their hereditary tzaddikim.”<span className=\"SuperScript\">7</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;But this does not shed light on how the\n            principle took hold originally, well over a century before the challenges\n            of the twentieth century. Following in the footsteps of many earlier\n            researchers, Dan explores the historical and theological roots of the\n            institution of the tsaddik: the relationship to Sabbateanism, the media-\n            tion between heaven and earth, the responsibility of the tsaddik to\n            channel blessings to his community, and so on. But nowhere does Dan\n            explain why this theology required “the establishment of hereditary\n            leadership in the people of Israel after almost a millenium of its\n            absence.”<span className=\"SuperScript\">8</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n            In her now-classic essay “Hasidism after 1772: Structural Continuity\n            and Change,”<span className=\"SuperScript\">9</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ada Rapaport-Albert demonstrates that in the earliest\n            period—the era of the Baal Shem Tov (d. 1760) and the Maggid of\n            Mezhirech (d. 1772)—there was no dynastic principle at all. Rather,\n            Hasidism began as a “loose association of autonomous units,” and no\n            thought was given to the inheritance of leadership. Indeed, the Maggid of\n            Mezhirech, a charismatic figure of enormous power and stature, actively\n            worked to promulgate Hasidism as a decentralized movement, with no\n            thought of bequeathing a unified body of followers to his own biological\n            heir.<span className=\"SuperScript\">10</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Following Shmuel Ettinger’s observation that “[The Maggid] set up\n            group after group with a pupil at the head of almost every one,” Rapaport-\n            Albert concludes that the Maggid worked actively to establish courts in\n            different centers—led by disciples, not descendents.<span className=\"SuperScript\">11</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n            So how and why did the principle of dynastic succession take hold?\n            Rapaport-Albert suggests that this mode of organization arose to preserve\n            the distinctive identities of the various schools after the death of the\n            founder.<span className=\"SuperScript\">12</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;But this suffers from circularity: if, as Rapaport-Albert amply\n            demonstrates, Hasidism began as a fraternity of leaders and followers\n            loosely bound together by a distinctive set of religious practices and theo-\n            logical teachings, why could the movement not have continued on that\n            basis? And if various schools developed as the movement grew and\n            matured, why could not the “distinctive identity” of a school be preserved\n            by a gifted disciple as well or better than by a son? Later in the same essay\n            Rapaport-Albert suggests that the Polish-Russian pattern of inheritance of\n            noble estates may have served as a model.<span className=\"SuperScript\">13</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is indeed quite plausible,\n            but we would still need to understand what internal forces arose within\n            Hasidism at this time which made the aristocratic model appear attractive\n            and legitimate. Rapaport-Albert poses the problem with admirable clarity:\n            “The matter has not been addressed by scholars, but the institutionaliza-\n            tion of the hereditary principle in both tsaddikism and hasidism should\n            not be taken as self-explanatory.”<span className=\"SuperScript\">14</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n            In point of fact, the move to hereditary succession was neither\n            inevitable nor universal. Rabbi Elimelekh of Lyzhansk passed away in 1787,\n            and it was his students such as the Seer of Lublin, the Maggid of\n            Kozienice, and Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel of Apta who were seen as\n            his primary successors.<span className=\"SuperScript\">15</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;In Eretz Israel, after the death of Rabbi Menahem\n            Mendel of Vitebsk in 1788, Rabbi Abraham Kalisker was widely if not uni-\n            versally acknowledged as the former’s legitimate successor and the leader\n            of the Hasidic Yishuv in the Holy Land. In the Ukraine, R. Levi Yitzhak of\n            Berdichev passed away in 1810, and despite his enormous reputation and\n            influence, he never established a dynasty; his sons were rabbis and schol-\n            ars, but they never became “Berdichever Rebbes.”<span className=\"SuperScript\">16</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Bratslav Hasidim\n            rejected the dynastic principle entirely by regarding the death of Rabbi\n            Nahman in 1810 as in some sense not real; the founder continued to lead\n            them as an ongoing living presence.<span className=\"SuperScript\">17</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;In White Russia, after the death of\n            Rabbi Shneur Zalman in 1813, a struggle for succession developed between\n            one of the rabbi’s sons and a gifted disciple, with the result hardly a fore-\n            gone conclusion.<span className=\"SuperScript\">18</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;In Polish Hasidism, the hereditary principle never tri-\n            umphed completely, as time and again a charismatic senior disciple\n            attracted the younger Hasidim of an aging or deceased master. As late as\n            the mid-nineteenth century, the Halakhic authority and tsaddik Rabbi\n            Hayyim Halberstam could write that the office of Hasidic rebbe should\n            not be inherited, since “I do not know how the ability to pray can be\n            inherited.”<span className=\"SuperScript\">19</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n            Stephen Sharot has studied the Hasidic dynasties from a sociological\n            perspective, drawing upon Max Weber’s work on the routinization of\n            charisma.<span className=\"SuperScript\">20</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;While Sharot acknowledges that “[n]o detailed theology was\n            developed to justify the dynastic principle,” he makes reference to a\n            Hasidic belief that “the holy thoughts of the tsaddik at the time of concep-\n            tion would bring down an exceptional soul from heaven and that a child\n            conceived and brought up in holiness would himself be holy.”<span className=\"SuperScript\">21</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;He further\n            notes that “it was considered important for not only the tsaddik but also\n            his wife to be of pure lineage. First-cousin marriages strengthened the\n            ‘holy seed’ of the next tsaddik.”<span className=\"SuperScript\">22</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n            In a similar vein, Louis Jacobs has written that “particularly from the\n            period of the Seer of Lublin, the idea of dynastic succession took hold, in\n            the belief that the tsaddik’s holy thoughts when he made love to his wife\n            could succeed in drawing down a specially elevated soul into the child\n            conceived, who was thereby ideally suited to take his father’s place when\n            the father departed this life.”<span className=\"SuperScript\">23</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n            The term “holy seed”—zera kodesh—occurs frequently in Hasidic dis-\n            cussions of tsaddikim and their families. It appears originally in the Bible\n            (Ezra 9:2; cf. Neh. 9:2), in the context of the post-exilic program of forbid-\n            ding intermarriage and banishing foreign wives, so that the “holy seed”\n            would no longer “mingle with the people of the land.”<span className=\"SuperScript\">24</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;When applied to\n            Hasidic tsaddikim, it clearly suggests a theology of genealogical sanctity,\n            involving the wife and her yihus (distinguished ancestry) no less than the\n            husband.\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n            Yet most studies of Hasidism until now have largely overlooked the\n            significance of women even in matters of genealogy. To take one striking\n            example, the Encyclopaedia Judaica has an excellent chart of the relation-\n            ships of the leading Hasidic dynasties, from the Baal Shem Tov to the pre-\n            sent times, containing hundreds of names. With the exception of the Baal\n            Shem Tov’s daughter, women are completely absent. The key to the chart\n            lists the following relationships: father, son, grandson, son-in-law, teacher-\n            disciple; but not mother, wife, daughter, or sister-in-law. This near-com-\n            plete omission confirms an unfortunate pattern to which feminist\n            historians have called attention and which they have attempted to redress.\n            As Joan Wallach Scott has written, “Recent research has shown that women\n            were not inactive or absent from events that made history, but that they\n            have been systematically left out of the official record.”<span className=\"SuperScript\">25</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall argue here\n            that the role of the wives and mothers of tsaddikim was pivotal in the emer-\n            gence of several key Hasidic dynasties and that the presence of women,\n            when brought to the foreground, will reveal much about Hasidism in its\n            economic, social, genealogical, and spiritual dimensions. The retrieval of\n            this suppressed presence will be the subject of the rest of this essay.<span className=\"SuperScript\">26</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Crisis of the Interregnum, 1802: Chava, the Mother of\n            Rabbi Israel of Ruzhin, and the Appearance of the Yenuka\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n            Around the year 1800 the distinctive identities of the various Hasidic\n            courts began to emerge into full view.<span className=\"SuperScript\">27</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1796, for example, Rabbi Shneur\n            Zalman of Liady published his famous work known popularly as Tanya,\n            which did so much to forge the special character of Habad Hasidism. In\n            1802 Rabbi Nathan of Nemirov, a devotee of Hasidism who had previously\n            visited many tsaddikim, became a faithful disciple of Rabbi Nahman of\n            Bratslav, apprenticing himself to this one master exclusively. As the fore-\n            most follower and amanuensis of Rabbi Nahman, Rabbi Nathan had a\n            central role in the crystallization of Bratslav Hasidism.<span className=\"SuperScript\">28</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;And in 1798, after\n            the death of Rabbi Menahem Nahum of Chernobyl, his son Rabbi Morde-\n            cai succeeded him; this has been called the first appearance of the dynastic\n            principle in Hasidism.<span className=\"SuperScript\">29</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was due in large measure to Rabbi Mordecai\n            that the House of Chernobyl became the exemplar of what is meant by a\n            Hasidic dynasty. He was among the first tsaddikim to establish an aristo-\n            cratic court on the grand style; each of his eight sons became a rebbe in\n            his own right, establishing courts in various Ukrainian towns and thereby\n            propelling the geographic diffusion of Chernobyl Hasidism and the move-\n            ment as a whole.<span className=\"SuperScript\">30</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n            David Assaf, in his recent biography of the celebrated tsaddik Rabbi\n            Israel of Ruzhin (1796–1850), states that “little is known about Chava,”\n            Israel’s mother.<span className=\"SuperScript\">31</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;And indeed, in the over five hundred pages of his meticu-\n            lously documented and insightfully written study of Rabbi Israel, Chava\n            receives only passing mention. In this, Assaf mirrors the more traditional\n            works of Hasidic hagiography, which, when they speak of Chava or most\n            other women, nearly always do so to highlight and frame the virtues of the\n            male tsaddik. Yet Chava lived to about seventy-five, an unusually long lifes-\n            pan in those days; she outlived Rabbi Shalom Shakhna, her husband and\n            Rabbi Israel’s father, by forty-two years. (Rabbi Shalom Shakhna was the\n            grandson of the Rabbi Dov Ber, the Maggid of Mezhirech, the most famous\n            figure in Hasidism after the Baal Shem Tov and widely considered the actual\n            founder of Hasidism as an organized movement.) She accompanied her son\n            through every stage of his controversial and stormy career and died in Sad-\n            gora only six years before he did. It is hard to believe that she was not a sig-\n            nificant influence on her famous son, despite the near silence of the sources.\n            In such a circumstance it seems appropriate to carefully examine and\n            reassess the materials we have, bringing neglected information to the fore-\n            ground and looking for patterns which eluded or were not of interest to\n            earlier writers. What emerges not only will tell us much about women in\n            Hasidism, but will shed new light on the Hasidic movement as a whole.<span className=\"SuperScript\">32</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;One unusual phenomenon which appeared early in the Hasidic move-\n            ment was the yenuka, the “wonder-child” who assumes a leadership role at\n            a very young age. As Assaf notes, perhaps the very first yenuka in Hasidism\n            was Abraham (1787–1813), Chava’s eldest son. When Abraham’s father\n            Rabbi Shalom Shakhna died in 1802, the fifteen-year-old Abraham took\n            over the leadership of his father’s Hasidim. Rabbi Shalom Shakhna died\n            just before Sukkot that year, and as the Hasidim tell the story, “on the first\n            night of Sukkot [just hours after his father’s funeral and burial] Rabbi\n            Abraham entered the sukkah, sat on his father’s seat, and began to assume\n            the reins of leadership, in the grand manner, as his father’s successor.”<span className=\"SuperScript\">33</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;The assumption of communal leadership by a fifteen-year-old boy was\n            noted with derision by the maskilim. Joseph Perl mentions Abraham by\n            name in his anti-Hasidic polemic, Uiber das Wesen der Sekte Chassidim (On\n            the Nature of the Sect of the Hasidim), completed in 1816.<span className=\"SuperScript\">34</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;And from that\n            time on, the phenomenon of the yenuka became a frequent target of maskilic\n            scorn and satire. We will have more to say about a later instance of this below.\n            Abraham’s behavior is never fully explained in the Hasidic sources.\n            Many of the faithful probably saw it as just one more example of the\n            preternatural powers of the tsaddik, often expressed in patterns of action\n            which cannot be comprehended by lesser mortals. The more learned\n            undoubtedly recalled passages in the Zohar where a yenuka makes an\n            appearance, bringing particularly sublime and recondite wisdom.<span className=\"SuperScript\">35</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;For his\n            part, Assaf sees Abraham’s action as “cynical behavior,” a power-grab by a\n            youngster who, in his “urgent need for legitimization,” rushed to gain the\n            assent of his family to his succession.<span className=\"SuperScript\">36</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;But how plausible is it that a\n            youngster, barely fifteen years old (as Joseph Perl already pointed out in\n            1816), is so filled with the urge for power and the attendant burdens and\n            responsibilities of communal leadership, that he grabs the reins just a few\n            hours after his dead father has been interred? It is certainly reasonable to\n            ask whether an adult may have been involved in the decision.\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n            The main account of young Abraham’s succession appears in a hagio-\n            graphic collection of Ruzhin traditions known as Bet Yisrael (House of\n            Israel), originally published in 1913 by Reuben Zak.<span className=\"SuperScript\">37</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;The stories about\n            Rabbi Abraham do not hide the astonishment felt by many, even among\n            the Hasidim, that such a youngster had assumed the reins of his father’s\n            community.\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n            It is interesting that nearly all the accounts of this episode make specific\n            mention of Abraham’s mother. One such tradition states that\n            on that night of Sukkot [Abraham] took his younger brother, the future\n            Ruzhiner Rebbe [who was six years old at the time], and wanted to enter the\n            sukkah. He said, “We must first go to our mother the zaddeket and say Gut\n            Yom Tov (essentially, Happy Holiday) to her.” He told her, “God now has a\n            new guest in heaven; we ought to send Him something in honor of the\n            guest. What should I send? I will say Kiddush in his honor.” So he entered\n            the sukkah and made Kiddush.<span className=\"SuperScript\">38</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n            Chava’s response is not recorded, but her silence suggests agreement. And\n            the line “‘We must first go to our mother the zaddeket (a saintly individ-\n            ual) . . .’” may be a way of hinting at the obvious: that no family decision—\n            especially at such a time, and of such consequence—could have been\n            made without the mother, and that Chava may have been actively involved\n            from the very beginning. In any event, it is clear that Abraham was con-\n            cerned to receive his mother’s consent, post facto if not ab initio.\n            Consider the following: Chava was a granddaughter of Rabbi Menahem\n            Nahum of Chernobyl (1730–1797), a foundational personality from\n            Hasidism’s early period, a disciple of the Baal Shem Tov and the Maggid of\n            Mezhirech, and the author of the seminal work Me’or Eynayim (The Light\n            of the Eyes).<span className=\"SuperScript\">39</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Chava’s uncle was Rabbi Menahem Nahum’s son and suc-\n            cessor, Rabbi Mordecai of Chernobyl (1770–1837). As noted above, he was\n            one of the first tsaddikim to live on a grand scale, in the manner of Russ-\n            ian nobility.<span className=\"SuperScript\">40</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n            Rabbi Shalom Shakhna enjoyed a successful tenure as rebbe in Proho-\n            bitch. His popularity extended to the wider region; he was a well-known\n            and respected personality throughout Ukrainian Hasidism.<span className=\"SuperScript\">41</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;He must\n            have had a sizable following. In light of this, it should come as no surprise\n            that he had already begun living in a princely manner, much unlike his\n            ascetic father, Rabbi Abraham “the Angel.” This mirrors the generational\n            trajectory that his wife Chava had experienced in Chernobyl. Her grandfa-\n            ther Rabbi Menahem Nahum had lived a life of extreme self-denial and\n            poverty, while his son Rabbi Mordecai—Chava’s uncle—had introduced\n            the aristocratic style of leadership.\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n            At the time of Rabbi Shalom Shakhna’s passing in 1802, Chava was\n            confronted with the dissipation of his community and the collapse of\n            her position within it. We recall that at this time dynastic rights were\n            not universally asserted or recognized, and the very notion of an “heir”\n            to the seat of a tsaddik had not fully crystallized. In general the corpo-\n            rate identity of a Hasidic community did not long survive without\n            direct personal contact with a living master.<span className=\"SuperScript\">42</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the announce-\n            ment of a successor, the Hasidim of Prohobitch would have naturally\n            dispersed, each looking for a new tsaddik in some other location. But if\n            the Hasidic community of Prohobitch were not to survive with its iden-\n            tity intact, Chava would have been just another widow with most\n            uncertain prospects. And without dynastic succession, her two sons\n            would have been not heirs, but mere orphans in a society which had no\n            dearth of fatherless children.\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n            The force of these concerns is brought into greater relief when seen in\n            light of an earlier episode in the family’s history. Rabbi Abraham the\n            Angel—Rabbi Shalom Shakhna’s father, son of the Maggid of\n            Mezhirech—had himself died young, in the fall of 1776. His widow, Gitl,\n            left her two young children and went to Eretz Israel, spending the rest of\n            her life there in obscurity. The two orphans were taken in by the tsaddik\n            Rabbi Shlomo of Karlin, who educated them and found appropriate\n            matches when the time came (the older brother married Rabbi Shlomo’s\n            own daughter, while Shalom Shakhna was betrothed to the granddaughter\n            of Rabbi Menahem Nahum of Chernobyl—our Chava). Gitl’s departure\n            was never explained, and the whole episode is shrouded in obscurity. But\n            the abandonment of the eight-year old Shalom Shakhna by his mother,\n            just after the death of his father, must have profoundly shaken him and\n            left its mark on the entire family. Now, one generation later, Rabbi Shalom\n            Shakhna had himself died, leaving two young children. It must have\n            seemed an eerie echo of the past, with history in danger of repeating itself.\n            The fifteen-year-old Abraham would have had strong motivation to step\n            in and try to fill his father’s shoes, for his own sake as well as for his\n            mother’s. Nothing would have been more important than the stability of\n            the family, which required the continuity of the community his father had\n            built up.\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n            Abraham and his mother, Chava, had a convergence of interests. The\n            fifteen-year-old still needed his mother, for himself and his six-year-old\n            brother, Israel. And if he was to succeed as a rebbe, he surely needed the\n            guidance and experience his mother could provide. Chava would have\n            known the Hasidim as individuals—not just their personal idiosyncrasies\n            and aspirations, but the role each Hasid played in the constellation of her\n            late husband’s community. This detailed information would have been\n            indispensable for an inexperienced youngster trying to lead a group of\n            followers out of a crisis of continuity. For her part, Chava needed her\n            son Abraham, for, being a woman, she could not officially lead the\n            Hasidim. As a Twersky of Chernobyl, she had had first-hand knowledge\n            of the emerging aristocratic leadership style. But whatever her depth of\n            experience and knowledge, only her son Abraham could be the tsaddik.\n            Only he could avert the dissolution of the community her husband had\n            built. In light of this convergence of interests, it is only reasonable to\n            assume that Chava would have assisted her son in his consolidation of\n            leadership, and she may have pointed the way from the very beginning.\n            This supposition receives support from the repeated references to Chava’s\n            motherly guidance of Abraham and Israel. (Abraham died in 1811, at\n            which point Israel assumed leadership of the community. Strikingly,\n            Israel was then fifteen years old—the same age his older brother Abra-\n            ham was in 1802, when he first sat in his father’s seat!) Hasidic tradition\n            preserves memories reflecting Chava’s deep concern for her children’s\n            development, even from before birth. There is a notable remark from the\n            Apter Rav, Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, considered Hasidism’s most\n            senior and revered figure in the last decade of his life (1815–1825).<span className=\"SuperScript\">43</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;When\n            Chava was pregnant with her younger son, Israel, the future Ruzhiner\n            Rebbe, the Apter is quoted as calling Chava “the Holy Ark” who was car-\n            rying (in her womb) a Torah scroll.<span className=\"SuperScript\">44</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be a mistake to dismiss\n            this as nothing but typical Hasidic exaggeration, a pious encomium for a\n            future leader. The phrase “Holy Ark” (Aron ha-Kodesh) resonates with\n            Kabbalistic meaning, alluding to the Sefirah of Malkhut, or “sovereignty,”\n            and associated with the receptive feminine aspect of the divine realm,\n            also known as Shekhinah.<span className=\"SuperScript\">45</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;To anyone with even a modest familiarity\n            with Kabbalistic symbolism, this would have suggested that the union of\n            Chava with her husband, Rabbi Shalom Shakhna, was a sacred rite des-\n            tined to produce extraordinary offspring. A related tradition states that\n            during the entire nine months of her pregnancy with Israel, Chava was\n            secluded in her private chamber. No one came into her room other than\n            her maids and ladies-in-waiting, thus protecting the pure and holy soul\n            of the future Ruzhiner Rebbe from wayward glances and influences.<span className=\"SuperScript\">46</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;These traditions reflect an intense level of agency on Chava’s part in the\n            spiritual development of her offspring.\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n            Chava’s active involvement in the upbringing of her children continued\n            during their childhood and apparently intensified after the death of her\n            husband. The sources tell of visits to the great tsaddikim of the day to\n            receive their blessing, including the Seer of Lublin<span className=\"SuperScript\">47</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;and the Apter Rav.\n            Around 1805 (three years after her husband’s death) Chava brought the\n            two brothers to Berdichev, home of Rabbi Levi Yitzhak. Rabbi Shneur Zal-\n            man of Lyady, the founder of Habad Hasidism, who was visiting in\n            Berdichev at the time, is said to have been greatly impressed with Israel’s\n            profound religious insight.<span className=\"SuperScript\">48</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture which emerges from these stories\n            is that of a mother engaged in the project of introducing her sons to the\n            foremost Hasidic leaders of the era. As a devotee of Hasidism, she was\n            undoubtedly following the pious practice of securing blessings from holy\n            masters; but it also seems evident that she was intent on grooming her\n            sons, orphaned from their father, in the ways of the tsaddikim. In addi-\n            tion, these courtesy calls built support among influential leaders to legiti-\n            mate her sons’ succession.\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n            At times Chava appears as an unspoken but clear presence in her sons’\n            life. An example of this is Israel of Ruzhin’s Tosefet Ketubah—a codicil of\n            supplementary provisions to the ketubah, the traditional marriage con-\n            tract. In this fascinating document, recently published for the first time,<span className=\"SuperScript\">49</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;the boilerplate ketubah obligation has been augmented by the sum of 1,548\n            rubles. This substantial commitment indicates that the family already had\n            considerable financial resources. And the date (9 Elul 5569) reveals that\n            Israel was wed in 1809, at age twelve—before his Bar Mitzvah!<span className=\"SuperScript\">50</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that\n            he had no father, it is impossible to suppose that his mother was not\n            involved in the arrangements and negotiations. Significantly, young Israel\n            is repeatedly referred to as ha-yanik—a variant form of the word yenuka\n            we have already encountered, but here in a legal document. The word\n            bespeaks his youth and precocity. But it also conveys a hint of its etymo-\n            logical origin, from yanak—to suckle, nurse, breast-feed—hence pointing\n            to a mother hovering in the background, providing nurturance and guid-\n            ance, even if not acknowledged.\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n            We have a report from the early years of Israel’s marriage that Israel\n            refused to perform his marital duty. He gave pious reasons for his behav-\n            ior, but it must also be remembered that he was scarcely a teenager at this\n            time. In any event, Chava sought the intervention of Rabbi Abraham\n            Joshua Heschel of Apta, who was able to assure Israel that “engagement in\n            the commandment to be fruitful and multiply” was entirely proper and\n            that he would be blessed with children worthy of his sacred lineage.<span className=\"SuperScript\">51</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel of Apta was also the source for an\n            extraordinary and widely circulated claim made about the Ruzhiner: that\n            he never forgot what the angel had taught him in his mother’s womb.<span className=\"SuperScript\">52</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;This relates to the old rabbinic aggadah (legend) that for the nine\n            months of gestation, babies in the womb are taught Torah by an angel,\n            only to be tapped on the mouth at birth, forgetting everything.<span className=\"SuperScript\">53</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;A\n            prominent follower of the Ruzhiner, Rabbi Reuven Horenstien of Odessa,\n            was astonished at the thought that his master had retained his prenatal\n            memories, and once ventured to ask the rebbe, “‘How can such a thing\n            be?’” The Ruzhiner replied, “‘Go ask my mother.’” Rebbetzin Chava\n            answered as follows:\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n            “There is indeed a rabbinic teaching that an angel studies the entire Torah\n            with the baby before he is born into this world. Just as he is about to leave\n            his mother’s womb, an angel comes, slaps him on the mouth, and he forgets\n            everything. But these very different tasks—that of teaching, and that of\n            expunging memories—are not performed by the same angel, rather by two\n            different angels. What then, gives rise to the Angel of Forgetting? It is the\n            final thought of intercourse [the self-awareness of orgasm]. Believe me that\n            neither I nor my late husband, Rabbi Shalom of Prohobitch, had such a\n            thought at that time, so no Angel of Forgetting was created. That is why my\n            son remembers everything.”<span className=\"SuperScript\">54</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n            In this extraordinary exchange, Chava is asserting the unique spiritual\n            power of her son; more, she is asserting her co-responsibility—along\n            with her late husband—for engendering that power in an act of concep-\n            tion without sexual lust. By avoiding the indulgence of orgasmic forget-\n            ting, Chava and Rabbi Shalom Shakhna were in control of their sexual\n            natures. Having maintained their spiritual awareness at a moment when\n            most couples surrender to passion, they birthed a child continually in\n            contact with God and His pristine Torah. Furthermore, by referring the\n            questioner to his mother, the Ruzhiner was effectively endorsing her\n            reply: his birth was the result of a sacred union, and his charismatic\n            powers derived from his mother as much as his late father. And the nar-\n            rative frame of the story—in which a prominent follower turns to the\n            great tsaddik’s mother for a decades-old truth that only she could\n            know—inscribes Chava’s role as matriarch of the family, as the reposi-\n            tory of sacred knowledge and history, and as the wise guardian of origins\n            and bedrock of dynastic identity.\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n            Finally, there is an astonishing family tradition that the Ruzhiner attrib-\n            uted his imprisonment in Kiev to his mother, Chava. During the period of\n            incarceration (1838–1840) Chava longed to hear some word from her son.\n            A certain Hasid managed to gain entry to the Ruzhiner’s cell and was able\n            to converse with him. As the visit ended, the Hasid asked the tsaddik for a\n            sign, a signal by which he could prove to Chava that he had actually met\n            with her son. Rabbi Israel responded, “‘Tell my mother that she is respon-\n            sible for my entire incarceration.’” When the Hasid reported on his visit to\n            Chava and told her what her son had said, she replied:\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n            “That’s exactly right—It’s my fault that my son is in prison. Let me tell you\n            the story. Before he gave birth in holiness to his youngest son [Mordecai\n            Shraga of Husyatin], he came to me and said that he has the opportunity to\n            bring down a very great and lofty soul, such as the world has not seen in the\n            last two thousand years; but as a consequence he would be forced to suffer a\n            painful exile.

Here she is depicted as the\n            matriarch of the family, steering it toward a glorious spiritual destiny at\n            whatever cost to her son’s physical or material welfare. Whatever we make\n            of the theology implicit in this story, it places Chava in the role of behind-\n            the-scenes guide to her son on a matter of utmost gravity, of vital concern\n            to the lineage and her family’s future.\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n            When taken in the aggregate, the sheer number of vignettes and remi-\n            niscences which feature Chava is impressive.

Willy-nilly, these memories testify to\n            Chava’s ongoing leadership in the Ruzhin dynasty.\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n            So far as I know, we have no correspondence from Chava, but one item\n            which did survive is Chava’s ring, extant to this day.<span className=\"SuperScript\">57</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;On one side are\n            engraved the words “To light the Sabbath lamp,” and on the other, “Chava\n            daughter of our master Rabbi Abraham, may God preserve and redeem\n            him.” Such a ring, crafted at a time when her father was still living,\n            bespeaks a confident self-awareness of aristocratic position.<span className=\"SuperScript\">58</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;In all, we\n            catch sight of an influential woman, utilizing her stature to advance the\n            situation of her sons while securing her place at the very core of\n            Hasidism’s new aristocracy. While any analysis of her motives must\n            include the factors of economic self-interest and social position, for Chava\n            these considerations would have been totally intermingled with thoughts\n            of her venerable ancestors, on the one hand, and her belief in her sons as\n            tsaddikim, on the other. Chava surely believed that the great legacy of the\n            Maggid of Mezhirech, Rabbi Abraham the Angel, her husband, Rabbi\n            Shalom Shakhna, and her grandfather Rabbi Menahem Nahum of Cher-\n            nobyl could best be preserved and transmitted by the sacred souls which\n            she had brought into the world.\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n            Let us now return to that first night of Sukkot in 1802, mere hours after\n            the death of Rabbi Shalom Shakhna. We will never know in full what\n            motivated the newly orphaned boy to move (quite literally) into his\n            father’s seat, to the chagrin and astonishment of the Hasidim. But it was\n            surely the case that Abraham sought and received his mother’s consent,\n            post facto if not ab initio. Rising to the role of filial successor—a role still\n            rare and unexpected in Hasidism—Abraham, with his mother’s support,\n            saved the cohesive community built by his father from immediate dissipa-\n            tion. Crystallized around family loyalty and the memory of great prede-\n            cessors, the community’s identity remained intact, much as had already\n            happened in Chava’s own family where the Hasidic community of Cher-\n            nobyl had become a proprietary domain. With his mother as his silent\n            partner, the son laid the foundation for what would soon flower into the\n            great lineage of Mezhirech-Prohobitch-Ruzhin.

His incumbency as leader of the Karlin-Stolin Hasidim\n            lasted forty-five years. When he died in 1872, he was succeeded by his son\n            Rabbi Asher the Second (1827–1873). But Rabbi Asher died only one year\n            after his father, and Karlin-Stolin Hasidism was beset by a crisis of conti-\n            nuity, having sustained in rapid succession the loss of two beloved leaders.\n            The only male heir was Rabbi Asher’s son, Israel, who was about four and\n            a half years old at the time of his father’s passing. When the child was\n            about five years old, the Stolin elders announced that Israel had been des-\n            ignated his father’s successor and would henceforth lead the Hasidic com-\n            munity of Stolin.<span className=\"SuperScript\">61</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n            When this turn of events became known to the wider community, it\n            provoked astonishment; almost immediately maskilim rushed to satirize\n            what in their view was an absurd example of Hasidic credulousness. The\n            best-known example is “Hitgalut ha-Yenuka mi-Stolin,” signed “Had min\n            Havraya,” a pseudonym meaning “One of the Fellows.” One question\n            which seems not to have been asked by either the maskilim or the subse-\n            quent scholarly writers on this topic is, Why did the Stoliner Hasidim do\n            it? That is, even granting their putative naivete, there must have been a\n            compelling reason which led them to the extraordinary step of appointing\n            a five-year-old as their leader.

The “Hitgalut” actually has a\n            composite character, with two distinct sections. The article begins and\n            concludes with a “Letter to the Editor,” which introduces and frames the\n            core document, a letter from “the Rabbi of Turov, a town near Pinsk.” The\n            tone of the two sections differs dramatically. The frame letter is a typical\n            maskilic satire, by turns ludicrously pompous, bathetic, and ribald, with\n            repeated references to the rumored sexual inadequacy of the tsaddikim. By\n            contrast, the core letter is entirely serious. It does herald the advent of the\n            yenuka, and portrays him as gifted with an extraordinary intellect, musical\n            ability, and supernatural powers; it also claims for him a messianic soul.\n            But with all this, the tone is quite different from the carnivalesque style of\n            the frame letter, which is typical of anti-Hasidic parodies such Joseph\n            Perl’s Megaleh Temirin.<span className=\"SuperScript\">63</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;The core letter is characterized by an earnest and\n            plaintive note of urgency which accurately reflects the Karlin-Stolin crisis\n            of succession and the concern of the elders to hold the group together\n            around the child as titular leader.\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n            “The Rabbi of Turov” is a historical figure: his name is Ya’akov Noson\n            Weisman (c. 1832–1916), who indeed served as rabbi of Turov (a small\n            town east of Pinsk) and later emigrated to Eretz Israel where he was a\n            rabbi in Tiberias; he died in Safed in 1916.<span className=\"SuperScript\">64</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yehuda Leib Levin was shown\n            a copy of Weisman’s letter and grasped the opportunity to augment it into\n            a full-scale assault on Karlin-Stolin Hasidism. He wrote the frame letter\n            which enabled him to incorporate other scandalous and embarrassing\n            material. He also festooned Weisman’s original letter with mock-serious\n            footnotes, which added to the fun but further obscured the composite\n            character of the whole. The original, authentic letter without Levin’s\n            embellishments (but with a side-by-side Yiddish translation) appears in a\n            Yiddish-language journal published in Lemberg, Jsrulik (The Israelite), in\n            the issue of October 30, 1875.<span className=\"SuperScript\">65</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Levin tells the entire story in the year 1900,\n            in Hatchiah (The Renaissance), a Hebrew literary weekly published in\n            Chicago.<span className=\"SuperScript\">66</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n            For all their differences, Weisman’s original letter, Levin’s 1875 parody,\n            and Levin’s 1900 article agree on one thing: young Israel Perlow’s mother\n            had a hand in her son’s accession to the leadership of Karlin-Stolin. Levin\n            (1900) writes that the idea to give the Karlin-Stolin dynastic seat to the\n            child came from the mother’s circle of supporters (mekoraveha); the Rabbi\n            of Turov, who was acting as gabbai (administrative assistant) for the\n            mother, wrote and circulated his letter to gather support for the child’s\n            accession.\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n            Levin’s 1875 satire states that in contrast to tsaddikim who are accused\n            of living in extravagant style, “this lad drinks only a little wine in order to\n            get accustomed to sacred service; he eats little and dresses modestly. He\n            takes no pleasure in all the money he receives from thousands of hasidim,\n            for he gives it all to his mother.”<span className=\"SuperScript\">67</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n            But undoubtedly the most reliable source is Rabbi Weisman’s original\n            letter. Weisman mentions steps that were already taken to place the child\n            in charge of Karlin-Stolin institutions in both Russia and the Holy Land.\n            He continues, “His mother the Rebbetzin has the authority to appoint\n            overseers for governance of the sacred institutions, as well as tax collectors\n            (anshei ma’amad) of her choice. [This arrangement will hold] until the\n            righteous Shoot will grow to adulthood. . . . And everyone knows about\n            the matter of Jehoash of blessed memory.”<span className=\"SuperScript\">68</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n            The rather cryptic reference to Jehoash requires some elucidation. In 2\n            Kings 11–12 (cf. 2 Chronicles 22–24) Jehoash, son of Ahaziah, is the only\n            survivor of a bloody purge which attempted to eliminate every legitimate\n            contender for the Davidic throne. He is secreted away as an infant by his\n            aunt Jehoshiba and kept hidden for six years. In his seventh year,\n            Jehoshiba’s husband, the high priest Jehoiada, reveals the young lad to the\n            people, and Jehoash is anointed and crowned as king in a ceremony cele-\n            brating the renewal of the Davidic dynasty. The salient parallels are clear:\n            Davidic descent and messianic claims were advanced for young Israel Per-\n            low, he was a “child-king,” and his cause was being championed by a close\n            woman relative: for Jehoash, his aunt; in the case of Israel Perlow, his\n            mother. The naming of Jehoash at the very end of Weisman’s letter is\n            intended to invoke a powerful biblical precedent for the installation of a\n            child-leader, but it also points to the central role that young Israel’s\n            mother had in directing the course of events.\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n            Who was Israel Perlow’s mother? Born in 1844, her name was Sarah\n            Devorah Shapiro; she was a great-great granddaughter to Rabbi Israel\n            the Maggid of Kozienice (1737–1814), one of the founders of Hasidism\n            in Poland. Her first marriage, to a second cousin who was heir to the\n            Kozienice Hasidic dynasty, ended with her husband’s death in 1866.\n            The young widow soon remarried (1867), this time to Rabbi Asher\n            Perlow of Stolin (1827–1873), whose role as tsaddik of the Karlin-Stolin\n            line has already been mentioned.<span className=\"SuperScript\">69</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;When Sarah Devorah left Congress\n            Poland for White Russia to marry Rabbi Asher, she brought along her\n            two children from her first husband, a boy and a girl. In Stolin, Sarah\n            Devorah presented her husband, Rabbi Asher, with three children, two\n            girls and a boy. The boy, born in 1868, was named Israel. When his\n            father died in 1873, it was he who was brought forward as successor;\n            he is our yenuka.\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n            Let us consider Sarah Devorah’s situation at the time of Rabbi Asher’s\n            death in 1873. She was twenty-nine years old. Within a span of just seven\n            years, she had lost two husbands (she had lived about six years with each\n            one). This was enough to stigmatize her and make it most unlikely that\n            she would ever marry again. But she was the mother of five children,\n            and—of special importance in Hasidic society—she had given birth to\n            two boys, each of whom was heir to a well-known lineage: Kozienice in\n            Poland, then Karlin-Stolin in White Russia. Sarah Devorah would have\n            had an intense personal interest in the deliberations regarding the choice\n            of a successor to her late husband, Rabbi Asher Perlow, and her efforts to\n            see her son installed are fully understandable.<span className=\"SuperScript\">70</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n            Sarah Devorah figures prominently in a memoir<span className=\"SuperScript\">71</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;written by her grand-\n            daughter and published in Israel in 1967. The granddaughter, whose name\n            was Malkah Shapiro, writes of her youth in Kozienice, Poland. The memoir\n            is set in 1905, after Sarah Devorah has returned from White Russia to her\n            native Poland, together with her son from her first marriage, Yerahmiel\n            Moshe Hapstein, who assumed the incumbent seat as Rebbe of Kozienice.\n            In Shapiro’s memoir, Sarah Devorah manages the affairs of the court\n            and makes all major decisions. She is appropriately respectful to her son,\n            who is after all the Rebbe, but Yerahmiel Moshe treats his mother with the\n            greatest reverence. She is constantly chastising him for endangering his\n            health with a grueling schedule of study and service, and with extreme\n            asceticism. A major point of contention is the question of building a new\n            mansion to replace the elegant home which was destroyed in a fire about\n            six years earlier. Sarah Devorah, along with a group of loyal and generous\n            Hasidim, conspires to go ahead with plans for new construction, but Yer-\n            ahmiel Moshe does his best to subvert their intentions. Eventually the new\n            house does begin to rise, due to Sarah Devorah’s indefatigable marshalling\n            of architectural, financial, and managerial resources. Speaking Polish, she\n            works with contractors, artisans, and suppliers of raw materials, conducts\n            labor negotiations, and deals with work stoppages and strikes. Everyone is\n            frightened of her: she need only give one look in the direction of a group\n            of chatting workers, and they fall silent and return to work. In addition to\n            managing the household and court in Kozienice, she owns a country\n            estate where the family would often spend summers. Shapiro remembers\n            her grandmother Sarah Devorah as a woman of elegance, culture, and\n            refinement, who prizes education and piety. Her knowledge of German\n            and of delicate embroidery techniques was obtained from a tutor whom\n            she herself had imported from Hungary. She maintains excellent relation-\n            ships with members of the Polish nobility; they respect her family heritage\n            and cultural sophistication, and share her aristocratic values rooted in an\n            era that was fast disappearing. But along with the ambience of majesty\n            and nobility that Sarah Devorah cultivates, there is also devout piety and\n            the fear of heaven. In between her managerial activities she prays and\n            recites psalms. The Rebbetzin’s blessings are sought by Polish peasants as\n            well as by Hasidim.\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n            As depicted in her granddaughter’s memoir, Sarah Devorah is a\n            dynamic, enterprising, and courageous individual who confidently travels\n            to the crown city of St. Petersburg for an interview at the Russian imperial\n            palace. With a memory of events going back to the first half of the nine-\n            teenth century, she is the repository and transmitter of the family’s sacred\n            traditions and foundational stories. Shapiro depicts her sitting at the head\n            of the table, surrounded by family members and Hasidim who listen in\n            rapt attention as she tells mystic stories from her childhood. She is domi-\n            neering and assertive, but these qualities are essential for her effectiveness\n            in managing the household and court.\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n            Sarah Devorah’s fears for her son’s health are entirely justified: Yerah-\n            miel Moshe died in 1909. She lived through the Great War, and it was she\n            who made the decision for the family to leave Kozienice for Warsaw when\n            the town became a battlefield. Scion of the Maggid of Kozienice and\n            widow of two major tsaddikim, it was she who nurtured and transmitted\n            the household’s sense of itself as a royal dynasty. She died in Warsaw in\n            1921 at age seventy seven, surviving both her sons.\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n            This portrait of Sarah Devorah is entirely consistent with the image\n            that emerges from the sources we have examined in connection with her\n            son Israel Perlow, the yenuka. In particular, Rabbi Weisman’s original let-\n            ter asserting her control of communal institutions and funds testifies to\n            her role as dynastic regent, the actual power behind her son, the “child-\n            king.”\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n            David Assaf has written about the enormous financial resources that\n            were necessary to run the large Hasidic courts such as that of Ruzhin, and\n            the techniques that arose to supply the requisite funds. But Assaf and his\n            primary sources say almost nothing about actual administration: who\n            made purchasing decisions and paid the bills; who hired, fired, and super-\n            vised the large staff of servants, workers, kitchen help, artisans, and con-\n            tractors; who oversaw the comings and goings of honored guests, Hasidic\n            pilgrims, and the poor; who decided on renovations, additions, and major\n            construction; who purchased real estate and invested assets, negotiated\n            with local and regional authorities, tracked the distribution of charitable\n            funds and the governance of religious institutions, and so on?<span className=\"SuperScript\">72</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a\n            major administrative role could only have been filled by a trusted intimate\n            of the tsaddik, most likely a close family member.<span className=\"SuperScript\">73</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Malkah Shapiro’s\n            memoir makes it clear that at least in one instance it was the family matri-\n            arch, Sara Devorah Shapiro, who filled that role.\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n            Nor can such a role be dismissed as marginal to the tsaddik’s spiritual\n            focus. The regal Hasidic court as it developed through the nineteenth cen-\n            tury expressed an embodied social theology. The tsaddik’s role as sacred\n            pivot of his community, as “axis mundi,”<span className=\"SuperScript\">74</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;was concretized in the court\n            itself, so that the structures of the court create a sacred domain analogous\n            to the sacred space of the biblical Tabernacle and the Jerusalem Temples.<span className=\"SuperScript\">75</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;The life of the court, in both its material and spiritual culture, displayed\n            the theology of the tsaddik and nurtured the experience of the Hasid who\n            came as pilgrim to see and to be seen.<span className=\"SuperScript\">76</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n            The Hasidic court was not characterized by sharp delineations between\n            the public and private, between domestic and communal. Hasidim, at least\n            Hasidic intimates, came into the family residence all the time. Rebbetzins\n            interacted with the entire community and could easily exercise control if\n            they so desired. So it should not surprise us that in some cases it was a\n            Rebbetzin such as Sarah Devorah Shapiro Perlow who guided the court’s\n            administration. Such a Rebbetzin should be thought of as a regent direct-\n            ing the spiritual and material fortunes of the lineage, bearing the dynasty’s\n            vision of itself.<span className=\"SuperScript\">77</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n            When writing of the Stolin yenuka, Haskalah (Jewish Enlightenment)\n            writers saw a story of venality, credulity, and superstition. They never\n            bothered to think much about the mother of the wonder-child, other than\n            to accuse her of appropriating the pidyon (redemption)-money. The “Hit-\n            galut ha-Yenuka mi-Stolin” parody does not even refer to her by name.\n            From the research presented here, however, a different picture emerges, a\n            narrative of a woman of courage, intelligence, and energy, working to\n            secure the continuity of her tradition and lineage. By struggling for her\n            son’s position as dynastic heir, she was assuring her own continued role as\n            queen mother, but she had every right to do so. Not the sovereign but the\n            regent, Sara Devorah Shapiro Perlow, was destined to be forever the power\n            behind the throne, the guardian of dynastic vision.\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n            Our analysis of Chava, mother of Rabbi Israel of Ruzhin, and Sarah Devo-\n            rah Shapiro Perlow suggests the following: where there is a yenuka, there is\n            likely a recently widowed mother, with very legitimate concerns about her\n            lineage, promoting the role of her son and thereby securing her own posi-\n            tion as well. After the crisis of the interregnum has passed and her son has\n            successfully taken his place as tsaddik, a woman such as Chava or Sara\n            Devorah would often settle into the role of dynastic elder, prized for first-\n            hand knowledge of the events, traditions, and personalities of bygone\n            days. If she also had the energy and ability, she might emerge as the de\n            facto if unacknowledged leader of the Hasidic community, making key\n            decisions and guiding its destiny as much as or even more than her son\n            the tsaddik.\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n            Hasidic writers would have had no reason to publicize such an arrange-\n            ment; wherever it existed, the Hasidim would have worked hard to shield\n            it from view. And that is why the large corpus of hagiographic literature\n            contains mere hints of the roles played by women such as Chava and Sara\n            Devorah. This underscores the importance of reexamining that literature,\n            as well as searching for documents and texts previously overlooked or\n            undiscovered.\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n\n            At one point in Malkah Shapiro’s memoir, she mentions that Sarah\n            Devorah Shapiro Perlow carried a pouch tied around her neck.

But while Rabbi Shalom Shakhna drew\n            on the spiritual power and prestige of the Great Maggid, in no sense did he\n            inherit an established Hasidic community, nor did he ever make the claim that\n            he was the designated successor to his illustrious grandfather. His Rebistve (rab-\n            binic office; tenured chair of a recognized tsaddik) in Prohobitch was his own\n            making. Similar remarks pertain to Rabbi Barukh of Medzibozh, grandson of\n            the Baal Shem Tov.\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBodyFN\">\n\n            11. Martin Buber begins his chapter on the Maggid of Mezhirech, in “Dov Ber\n            of Mezritch, the Great Maggid” (Tales of the Hasidim: Early Masters [New York,\n            1975]), with a story that depicts the five-year-old Dov Ber consoling his mother\n            on the loss of her family tree, burned in a fire which destroyed their house. The\n            tree traced the family’s lineage back to the great talmudic sage Rabbi Yohanan the\n            sandal-maker. The young Dov Ber is quoted as saying, “‘And what does that mat-\n            ter! I shall get you a new family tree which begins with me!’” (p. 98). But this\n            story, which appeared first in 1930 and purports to describe an event from around\n            1710, may be a retrospective projection of the later situation back to the time of\n            the illustrious paterfamilias. The story actually supports the thesis developed\n            herein: the dynastic vision emerges out of a child’s assuming responsibility for his\n            mother in the wake of crisis.\n            On the broader question of the reliability of hagiographic traditions, see\n            below, nn. 37–38. It is obvious that as the time between the ostensible event and\n            its first appearance in print increases, one’s confidence in its historicity dimin-\n            ishes proportionally. Here, there is a gap of over two hundred years, much too\n            long to give the story historical credence.\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBodyFN\">\n\n            12.

Green observes that “The very notion of inherited dynasty, the\n            right to authority in the Hasidic community by virtue of birth, smacked of royal-\n            ism” (p. 144). For the earliest examples of leadership in the regal style, Green\n            mentions Baruch of Medzibozh as well as Mordecai of Chernobyl. But Baruch is\n            not the best example of the pattern under discussion because while he drew on\n            the prestige of the Besht, he did not inherit an ongoing, established Hasidic com-\n            munity; see above, n. 10. There was a gap of nearly thirty years between the\n            Besht’s death and Baruch’s establishing his court in Medzibozh. And when\n            Baruch died in 1810, his sons-in-law did not inherit his court (he had no sons).\n            Shortly after Baruch’s death, Medzibozh became the seat of Abraham Joshua Hes-\n            chel (formerly of Apta), until the latter’s death in 1825.

The apparent lack of interest on the part of Rabbi Levi Yitzhak in establish-\n            ing a dynasty is conveyed in the following story, told by Rabbi Yitzhak of\n            Neskhizh (d. 1868), son of the famed tsaddik Rabbi Mordecai of Neskhiz (d.\n            1800). The story involves Rabbi Yitzhak himself and Rabbi Levi Yitzhak of\n            Berdichev. “The Rabbi of Berdichev, in his last year of life (c. 1810) sent for Rabbi\n            Yitzhak of Neskhizh to teach him the esoteric intentions of the mitzvah of Lulav\n            and Etrog. The descendents of the Berdichever became jealous of the rabbi of\n            Neskhizh, thinking, Why was the Berdichever teaching him and not them? The\n            Berdichever answered them as follows: ‘When old Rabbi Mordecai of blessed\n            memory [who had already died in 1800] will ask me in the World of Truth, What\n            did you teach my son? I will need something to answer him, so that’s why I’m\n            teaching him these esoteric intentions of Lulav and Etrog.’ Then the Berdichever\n            closed the door to his descendents and transmitted to Rabbi Yitzhak those secret\n            teachings.” The story, which appears in the collection Zikhron La-Rishonim\n            (reprinted Brooklyn, 1976 [original, Piotrkow, 1910]), pp. 135–136, has the effect of\n            promoting the standing of the teller, Rabbi Yitzhak. But it certainly captures accu-\n            rately the reality that Rabbi Levi Yitzhak did not groom a successor from his own\n            family.\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBodyFN\">\n\n            17.

The situation in Hasidism is rather similar if not identical: to\n            this day, the families of tsaddikim have a strong preference for endogamous\n            unions or, at a minimum, marriage to another aristocratic line, but there is no\n            actual prohibition against a Hasidic scion marrying a Jewish commoner.\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBodyFN\">\n\n            25.

Arthur Green, Menahem Nahum of Chernobyl: Upright Practices, The Light\n            of the Eyes (New York, 1982), notes that eventually this pattern of division and\n            fragmentation was to lead to the impoverishment of the Hasidic courts (p. 21, n.\n            22). See also Assaf, Regal Way, pp. 63–65; 307–309. But at the beginning of the\n            nineteenth century there was ample opportunity in the form of new territory to\n            be conquered for Hasidism. Thus, at this stage, the needs of family members to\n            stake out their own territory dovetailed nicely with the expansionist agenda of the\n            movement as a whole. The situation is reminiscent of the settling of New England\n            in the roughly two centuries before 1800. The goal of every farmer was to clear\n            enough land to set up each of his sons in an economically viable farm. Each suc-\n            ceeding generation cleared and cultivated new areas farther away from earlier set-\n            tlements. This process continued until they ran out of new territory, and there\n            was no more available land to clear; see Diana Muir, Reflections in Bullough’s\n            Pond: Economy and Ecosystem in New England (Hanover, 2000). Note, for exam-\n            ple, her remark that “For several generations . . . Massachusetts was a land of\n            plenty. [Colonial farmers] lived well, married young if they pleased, and reared\n            large families in the full confidence that their children would enjoy a life as com-\n            fortable as their own. . . . [E]arly-settled towns might not have had enough space\n            for every young couple to settle on, but there was land enough elsewhere to allow\n            the surplus young people of each generation to pioneer farms of their own” (pp.\n            47–48). One can look at the spread of Hasidic territories during the nineteenth\n            century in a similar way, as being largely driven by the ongoing branching of\n            dynastic trees, as successive generations of sons and sons-in-law of famous tsad-\n            dikim were motivated to find new towns in which to establish a rebistve.\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBodyFN\">\n\n            31.

This approach draws upon feminist methods of historical-theological\n            reconstruction, whose goal is not only the recovery of women’s voices as a\n            domain of interest, but the reconstruction of a movement’s history in light of\n            fresh awareness of women’s central role. See Elisabeth Schussler Fiorenza, In\n            Memory of Her (New York, 1983); note esp. ch. 2, “Toward a Feminist Critical\n            Method,” and ch. 3, “Toward a Feminist Model of Historical Reconstruction,” pp.\n            41–95. See also Fiorenza’s Bread Not Stone: The Challenge of Feminist Biblical\n            Interpretation (Boston, 1984), pp. 15–22. Following Paul Ricoeur, Fiorenza adopts a\n            “hermeneutic of suspicion,” by which texts placing women in a marginal role may\n            be interrogated to recover women’s central contributions. In my view such a\n            “hermeneutic of suspicion,” however useful, must be accompanied and comple-\n            mented by a hermeneutic of appreciation and gratitude.

Alfasi states that after\n            Rabbi Israel Abraham’s death in 1814, “his widow conducted herself as a Rebbe,”\n            and also offers the information that in 1834 she emigrated to the Holy Land and\n            was killed in the earthquake of 1837 (ibid.).

For Green’s discussion of the methodological issues, see pp. 6–14.\n            Immanuel Etkes makes extensive use of the first Hasidic hagiographical collec-\n            tion, Shivhei ha-Besht, for his study of the Baal Shem Tov in Ba’al Hashem: The\n            Besht—Magic, Mysticism, Leadership (Jerusalem, 2000), pp. 217–265. In contrast to\n            other scholars who treat Shivhei ha-Besht with great suspicion, Etkes, in a lengthy\n            excursus on Shivhei ha-Besht as a historical source, concludes that “a significant\n            proportion of the stories brought in this collection can be categorized as testi-\n            monies and reliable traditions anchored in the personal experiences of the Besht\n            and his circle” (p. 265).\n            The entire issue is discussed by David Assaf in his biography of Rabbi Israel of\n            Ruzhin (see above, n. 31). After noting the characteristics typical of hagiography,\n            such as avoidance of problematic topics, apologetic intent, naivete, exaggerations,\n            and imagination (Regal Way, pp. 8–28), Assaf nevertheless concludes that the crit-\n            ical scholar cannot disregard this genre but must take advantage of it by “sepa-\n            rat[ing] the wheat from the chaff. . . . [I]n any source that is not prima facie\n            unacceptable, there is a core of truth grounded in factual reality” (p. 26). Of spe-\n            cial importance for our purposes is Assaf ’s statement that “Although the pro-\n            nouncements attributed to Rabbi Israel and stories about him were published\n            many years after his death, it is assumed as a rule that the material is basically\n            authentic, although perhaps not as actually worded” (23).\n            Assaf and others have pointed out examples where specific hagiographic asser-\n            tions have received surprising confirmation in newly discovered historical materi-\n            als. It now seems clear that the very reason that Hasidic hagiographic writing is\n            often so tendentious—namely, the deep esteem and reverence of the writer for the\n            tsaddik—is precisely the impetus for collecting and preserving traditions about the\n            master with great care and zeal. In this paper we will assume that the stories about\n            the Ruzhiner and his family are in large measure genuine traditions transmitted\n            orally or in writing, sometimes for several generations, but that their mode of pre-\n            sentation and contextualization may reflect the interests and perspective of the\n            final editor or anthologist. It is therefore appropriate and necessary to read with\n            attention to anomalies, silences, gaps, and suppressed voices. See above, note 32.\n            Most important for our purposes is that the editor of the collections from\n            which we will quote often provides a named source for his stories. As Etkes and\n            others have noted, this type of attribution is generally quite reliable; it is not at all\n            the case that the editor is simply making up names or an attribution chain. See\n            the next note.\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBodyFN\">\n\n            38.

According to Aaron David Twersky, Sefer ha-Yahas mi-Chernobyl ve-Ruzhin\n            (Lublin, 1938; reprinted Brooklyn, 1990), Rabbi Mordecai was already living in\n            expansive style during his father’s lifetime. During a visit to his son, Rabbi Mena-\n            hem Nahum observed “gold and silver vessels and many clocks,” and asked what\n            need there was for such things (p. 5, #3). Rabbi Mordecai is said to have replied\n            with reference to Rabbi Judah the Patriarch, who according to the Talmud was\n            surrounded by abundance yet maintained a personal asceticism (see B.T. Ketubot\n            104). Whatever the historicity of this family tradition, it sheds light on how\n            Hasidism viewed the opulent lifestyle of the tsaddikim: Rabbi Judah the Patriarch\n            is remembered as the editor of the Mishnah as well as a revered and effective\n            communal leader who related to Roman rulers on equal terms; he embodied\n            “Torah and worldly grandeur in one place.” It should also not be overlooked that\n            Davidic descent was claimed for Rabbi Judah the Patriarch.\n            Twersky also states that Rabbi Mordecai of Chernobyl’s tenure as tsaddik\n            lasted “about fifty years” (p. 102, #1). If correct, this suggests that not only Rabbi\n            Mordecai’s lifestyle but his aristocratic court system may have originated during\n            his father’s lifetime. Rabbi Mordecai died in 1838; fifty years earlier brings us back\n            to 1788, almost ten years before Rabbi Menahem Nahum’s death in 1797 (see\n            Arthur Green, Menahem Nahum of Chernobyl, pp. 24–25). Other sources, how-\n            ever, say that Rabbi Mordecai led his community for about forty years; this would\n            place the beginning of his tenure about the time of his father’s death. See, for\n            example, Moshe Chaim Kleinman, Mazkeret Shem ha-Gedolim (Brooklyn, NY,\n            1976; original 1907); the text has no pagination but the passage appears at the very\n            end of the section devoted to Rabbi Mordecai.\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBodyFN\">\n\n            41.

Immanuel Etkes has described the attempt of Rabbi Menahem Mendel of\n            Vitebsk and Rabbi Abraham of Kalisk to lead White Russian Hasidism from Eretz\n            Israel in the 1780s. Their efforts were largely unsuccessful because Hasidim simply\n            began traveling to the courts of other tsaddikim in Volynia and elsewhere.\n            Immanuel Etkes, “The Rise of Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Lyady as a Hasidic\n            Leader,” Tarbiz, Vol. 54, No. 3 (1985), pp. 430–439.\n            In recent years we have the example of Hasidic communities after the Holo-\n            caust.

The fate of Alexander Hasidism is instructive: before World\n            War II, it was one of the largest groups in Poland. But no dynastic heir survived\n            to rebuild the community, and the remnant of Alexander Hasidim generally affili-\n            ated with dynasties that had a living tsaddik, typically Ger.\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBodyFN\">\n\n            43.

A version of this story is found in Kerem Yisrael, which states that the\n            meeting took place in Prohobitch at the time when Rabbi Shneur Zalman “was\n            returning from [St.] Petersburg,” presumably after his release from prison in 1801\n            (p. 58, #4). But if he was returning home to White Russia after his ordeal in St.\n            Petersburg, he would hardly have gone by way of Prohobitz, roughly 1000 miles\n            to the south. The location in Berdichev is mentioned by the grandson of Rabbi\n            Shneur Zalman, Rabbi Menahem Mendel Schneerson (“the Zemah Zedek”), in\n            Derekh Mitzvotekho (Brooklyn, NY: Kehot Publication Society, 1991); significantly,\n            the context there is the spiritual symbolism of the union of bride and groom (p.\n            277). Hayyim Meir Heilman, Beit Rabbi (Berdiehev, 1903), says the occasion was\n            “the wedding” (p. 123). Perhaps Heilman is referring to the betrothal of Israel and\n            his wife-to-be, Sarah, which took place in Berdichev in 1803. Some say that the\n            magnificent betrothal celebration was arranged by Rabbi Levi Yitzhak of\n            Berdichev himself, and it is at least plausible that Rabbi Shneur Zalman might\n            have made the journey to attend the reception in honor of the great-grandson of\n            his master the Maggid of Mezhirech.

Later sources tell an even more complicated story: there were some Sto-\n            liner Hasidim who were inclined to follow Sarah Devorah’s older son, named Yer-\n            ahmiel Moshe. He was about fourteen at the time of his stepfather’s death and\n            had recently married. According to these reports, the Stolin elders were fearful\n            that Yerahmiel Moshe might emerge as leader, in effect absorbing the Karlin-\n            Stolin lineage into that of Kozienice. It was to forestall such an outcome that the\n            elders moved to proclaim the five year old Israel Perlow as Rebbe.

There is a clear parallel here to the lavish country residences of the Russian\n            nobility which, as Priscilla Roosevelt has shown, expressed ideals of culture, fam-\n            ily wealth, and status, and embodied the relationship between land-ownership\n            and political power (Life on the Russian Country Estate [New Haven, 1995], p. 3).\n            It is certainly suggestive that, as Roosevelt notes, “[a]lmost all the great houses\n            were built between the mid-eighteenth and mid-nineteenth centuries, and the\n            majority were constructed during the nobility’s brief ‘golden age’” (p. xii)—the\n            decades just before and just after 1800, a time span remarkably coincident with\n            the period under discussion here, when the great Hasidic lineages arose and\n            flourished. This implies that the Hasidic adoption of aristocratic ways and resi-\n            dences was more than just a lifestyle choice, but embodied a sense of noble lin-\n            eage, a heraldry of rank to be transmitted from generation to generation.\n            <br/><br/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"PDFBodyFN\">\n\n            77.

In an effort to appeal to a\n              broad cross-section of the Jewish com-\n              munity, and to forestall defections, many\n              synagogues adopt a stance which cuts\n              across the neat ideological divisions fostered by the major branches of American\n              Judaism and their respective theological\n              seminaries.

Congregants sway\n              and chant in the traditional manner,\n              Hasidic melodies punctuate the service, and\n              large woolen tallitat (prayer shawls) are\n              de riguer. The quiet decorum which\n              characterized the classical Reform service is\n              conspicuously absent. Yet this is no\n              Hasidic shtibel: women may lead\n              services, and the congregation recently\n              published its own nonsexist prayerbook. The\n              general tone is informal and\n              participatory; a conscious effort is made to lessen\n              the physical and psychological distance\n              between rabbi and congregant.\n              Kushner has several books to his credit.\n              Unlike standard rabbinic literary\n              productions — warmed-over sermons and\n              moralistic and inspirational tracts —\n              Kushner has attempted to write seforim,\n              sacred texts meant to be studied and not\n              just read, in the English language. His\n              first book, The Book of Letters, combined\n              calligraphy and text in an evocative\n              presentation of the rabbinic and kabbalistic\n              traditions regarding the mystery and\n              power of the Hebrew language and its\n              constituent elements. In his second work,\n              Honey from the Rock: Vision of Jewish\n              Mystical Renewal, Kushner presented a\n              contemporary articulation of the\n              kabbalistic system of Sefirot.\n              <br/><br/>\n              </div>\n              <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n              His latest work, The River of Light:\n              Spirituality, Judaism, and the Evolution\n              of Consciousness (Rossel Books, $12.95\n              hardcover; Harper & Row, $8.95 paperback),\n              marks a new stage in Kushner's\n              development as a religious thinker and\n              writer.

While\n              many others have written about \"Freud\n              and Judaism\" using the methods of\n              intellectual history, he relies on a type of\n              phenomenological evocation which is\n              particularly appropriate for his subject.\n              Kushner charts new territory for\n              Jewish theology in his treatment of the\n              relationship between certain findings at the\n              cutting edges of contemporary science,\n              such as molecular biology and\n              astrophysics, and the teachings of Jewish\n              mysticism. Before we are able properly to\n              evaluate Kushner's contribution,\n              however, we must take a brief look at the\n              history of the uneasy interaction between\n              modern science and Jewish thought.\n              <br/><br/>\n              </div>\n              <div className=\"PDFBody\">\n              We are all familiar with the story of\n              the clash between Galileo and the Roman\n              Catholic Church.

It is\n              important to point out, however, that in\n              the medieval period and beyond, the\n              Jewish community had far less rigid\n              governance procedures and ecclesiastical\n              structures than did the Catholics. And\n              before we assume that Judaism in this\n              period was more open to new ideas and\n              more tolerant of divergent opinions, we\n              must recall that Jewish religious\n              authorities simply did not have the ability to\n              enforce total conformity.

Kushner reminds\n              u#fat this point of the teachings of Jewish\n              mysticism which place God as much\n              within us as in heaven, which affirm\n              divine immanence as much as divine\n              transcendence. There is no need, says\n              Kushner, to choose between these two views of\n              God; both are true in their own way:\n              The One of Being did not speak from\n              without or from within, but from without\n              and from within. . . . Our goal must\n              be to restore the balance, to place the\n              source of the voice, the source of reality,\n              everywhere.

Generally, however,\n              there was a quick return to less controversial\n              theological formulations.

However, as\n              Andre Suares once pointed out, there are\n              no heresies in a dead religion. If nothing\n              else, Lawrence Kushner's The River of\n              Light demonstrates that Judaism is very\n              much alive.\n              <br/><br/>\n              </div>\n
