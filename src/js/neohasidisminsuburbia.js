              ONE MIGHT ARGUE that, just as
              other religions have a characteristic
              devotional posture — such as kneeling or
              prostrating — so does American Juda-
              ism: leaning. In an effort to appeal to a
              broad cross-section of the Jewish com-
              munity, and to forestall defections, many
              synagogues adopt a stance which cuts
              across the neat ideological divisions fostered by the major branches of American
              Judaism and their respective theological
              seminaries. We thus hear of Orthodox
              synagogues "leaning to" Conservative,
              Reconstructionist "leaning to" Reform,
              and similar postural permutations. In a
              quiet Boston suburb, situated just outside
              the high-technology belt traced by Route
              128, a young rabbinic graduate of Hebrew
              Union College in Cincinnati named
              Lawrence Kushner is apparently evolving
              a new religious orientation, which might
              be called Reform-leaning-to-neo-Hasidic.
              Congregation Beth El, of which he is
              the rabbi, delights in resurrecting archaic
              traditions and rituals. Congregants sway
              and chant in the traditional manner,
              Hasidic melodies punctuate the service, and
              large woolen tallitat (prayer shawls) are
              de riguer. The quiet decorum which
              characterized the classical Reform service is
              conspicuously absent. Yet this is no
              Hasidic shtibel: women may lead
              services, and the congregation recently
              published its own nonsexist prayerbook. The
              general tone is informal and
              participatory; a conscious effort is made to lessen
              the physical and psychological distance
              between rabbi and congregant.
              Kushner has several books to his credit.
              Unlike standard rabbinic literary
              productions — warmed-over sermons and
              moralistic and inspirational tracts —
              Kushner has attempted to write seforim,
              sacred texts meant to be studied and not
              just read, in the English language. His
              first book, The Book of Letters, combined
              calligraphy and text in an evocative
              presentation of the rabbinic and kabbalistic
              traditions regarding the mystery and
              power of the Hebrew language and its
              constituent elements. In his second work,
              Honey from the Rock: Vision of Jewish
              Mystical Renewal, Kushner presented a
              contemporary articulation of the
              kabbalistic system of Sefirot.

              His latest work, The River of Light:
              Spirituality, Judaism, and the Evolution
              of Consciousness (Rossel Books, $12.95
              hardcover; Harper & Row, $8.95 paperback),
              marks a new stage in Kushner's
              development as a religious thinker and
              writer. It is his boldest and most
              ambitious book to date, distinguished for
              breadth of vision and elegance of expression.
              Like most seforim, it is structured
              as commentary on an earlier sacred text,
              in this case the story of Abraham's encounter
              with the three angelic guests, as
              elaborated by the Zohar.

              The exposition relies more on associative
              chains of thought than on linear
              argumentation; it freely switches levels of
              signification and universes of discourse.
              The author clearly intends the sense to
              reveal itself by a process of sympathetic
              interaction, and not by mere intellectual
              comprehension. Rather than stating his
              thesis — that a mystical unity obtains
              between the deepest core of the human
              psyche, the universe and God — in a
              didactic manner, Kushner allows his
              point to emerge gradually from the complexly
              textured patterns of the work itself.
              As is the case with much of classical
              rabbinic literature, the medium is an
              instantiation of the message.

              ON A NUMBER of levels, this book
              is a remarkable achievement. Judg-
              ed on the basis of stylistic criteria, it
              successfully captures the spirit of rabbinic
              The Christian CENTURYMidrash in a contemporary idiom.
              In exploring the parallels between the
              dynamics of biblical narrative and the dream
              state, Kushner convincingly demonstrates
              the close relationship between the Jewish
              exegetical tradition and the techniques of
              psychoanalytic interpretation. While
              many others have written about "Freud
              and Judaism" using the methods of
              intellectual history, he relies on a type of
              phenomenological evocation which is
              particularly appropriate for his subject.
              Kushner charts new territory for
              Jewish theology in his treatment of the
              relationship between certain findings at the
              cutting edges of contemporary science,
              such as molecular biology and
              astrophysics, and the teachings of Jewish
              mysticism. Before we are able properly to
              evaluate Kushner's contribution,
              however, we must take a brief look at the
              history of the uneasy interaction between
              modern science and Jewish thought.

              We are all familiar with the story of
              the clash between Galileo and the Roman
              Catholic Church. To this day, that
              episode is often evoked to symbolize the
              struggle between free inquiry and dogmatic
              rigidity of all kinds, and Galileo's
              words "e pur si muove" ("and yet it
              moves") are still quoted in the defense of
              intellectual freedom.

              Now it is a fact that no Jewish
              advocate of the views of Copernicus and
              Galileo was ever put on trial for heresy. It is
              important to point out, however, that in
              the medieval period and beyond, the
              Jewish community had far less rigid
              governance procedures and ecclesiastical
              structures than did the Catholics. And
              before we assume that Judaism in this
              period was more open to new ideas and
              more tolerant of divergent opinions, we
              must recall that Jewish religious
              authorities simply did not have the ability to
              enforce total conformity. While it is true
              that, as Andre Neher has pointed out,
              the Midrashic tradition of exegetical
              freedom allowed for a nonliteral reading of
              biblical texts which were cited as proof of
              a geocentric universe, nevertheless Jewish
              proponents of the heliocentric world view
              were often severely criticized. (This
              argument was suggested in a lecture by Hillel
              Levine of Boston University titled
              "Paradise Not Surrendered: Jewish Response
              to Copernicus,")

              Darwinian evolution theory caused at
              least as much consternation among Jewish
              believers as it did among Christians,
              and the spectrum of responses was
              similar in both cases (the world was created
              in seven literal days, but with an
              appearance of great antiquity; the seven "days"
              of the biblical account are not literal days
              but eons; and so on). To this day, much
              of the research and publishing activity of
              the Association of Orthodox Jewish
              Scientists relates to what, in Christian circles,
              is called creationist science. Reform
              Jewish writers have, in general, unreservedly
              affirmed the truth claims of modern
              science, with a few recent demurrals
              relating to the tyranny of technological
              control of human affairs, along the lines of
              Ellul, Mumford and others.

              AT PRESENT, few serious Jewish
              writers have awakened to the fact
              that the condition of the scientific enterprise
              has itself changed dramatically over
              the past 100 years. The verities of the
              classical period have been irrevocably
              shattered. There has been a revolutionary
              shift in the way we look at both macrocosmic
              and microcosmic events. This
              relates in part to the discovery of new facts
              previously unknown; but more significantly,
              there is a new understanding of
              what scientific "facts" are, and how they
              are shaped by the physical and conceptual
              tools of the investigator. There is a
              new apprehension of scientific knowledge
              as being socially constructed, and
              therefore not objective in quite the same way
              as had once been assumed. There is an
              emerging realization that the adoption of
              new scientific theories may sometimes
              have as much to do with techniques of
              persuasion as with supposedly
              incontrovertible evidence or the results of
              "crucial" experiments.

              particle "zoo" of bewildering diversity.

              the better part of a century. Yet, in the

              since the 19th century; the polar
              responses of defensive hostility and

              One looks in vain for the vigorous
              perspicacity of a Bishop Berkeley (1685-
              1735), who, not long after the appearance
              of Newton's classic work on the
              infinitesimal calculus, wrote a scathing
              attack called "The Analyst; a Discourse
              Addressed to an Infidel Mathematician,"
              in which he exposed the internal
              contradictions, unwarranted assumptions and
              general fuzziness of Newton's mathematical
              arguments. Berkeley noted caustically
              that anyone who could "digest a second
              or third fluxion, a second or third difference,
              need not . . . be squeamish about
              any point in Divinity." That Berkeley*s
              attack was not merely a case of gratuitous
              carping or sour grapes is demonstrated by
              the fact that the placing of the calculus
              on a sound methodological footing engaged
              some of the greatest mathematical
              thinkers — of the stature of Gauss,

              WITH THIS BACKGROUND in
              mind, Kushner's use of the find-
              ings of astrophysics, microbiology and
              other glamorous scientific specialties is
              particularly interesting. He avoids an
              excessive obeisance to the truth claims of
              the scientific world view, and resists the
              understandable temptation to use the new
              discoveries as a whetstone to sharpen his
              own doctrinal axe. For example, he notes
              the remarkable parallel between the
              recently discovered background microwave
              radiation, thought to be a residue of the
              cosmic "Big Bang," and the "hidden
              light" of the first moments of creation
              spoken of by the Midrash and Zohar. He
              does not use this point, however, to feed
              a sense of triumphalism that "we knew it
              all along." Rather, he suggests that the
              correspondences between the emerging
              scientific mythology and ancient religious
              truth should not surprise us because both
              reflect an essential connection between
              the universe, the Divine, and human
              consciousness.

              As the eminent physicist John Archibald
              Wheeler put it in a statement cited
              by Kushner, "The analysis of the physical
              world, pursued to sufficient depth, will
              lead back in some now-hidden way to
              man himself, to conscious mind, tied
              unexpectedly through the very acts of
              observation and participation to partnership
              in the foundation of the universe." One
              could hardly imagine a better contemporary
              Midrash on the verse, "And God
              created man in His own image . . ."
              But what kind of God are we now
              talking about? What, in particular, of the
              God of the biblical and rabbinic tradition
              who rewards, punishes, redeems, commands
              and reveals himself in moments of
              transcendent majesty? Kushner reminds
              u#fat this point of the teachings of Jewish
              mysticism which place God as much
              within us as in heaven, which affirm
              divine immanence as much as divine
              transcendence. There is no need, says
              Kushner, to choose between these two views of
              God; both are true in their own way:
              The One of Being did not speak from
              without or from within, but from without
              and from within. . . . Our goal must
              be to restore the balance, to place the
              source of the voice, the source of reality,
              everywhere. Inside us and outside us.
              The "I am the One of Being" which one
              tradition heard from on top of the
              mountain, could also have been heard from
              within every person. . . . The One we
              call the Holy One, and the ones the
              Holy One calls us, are the same beings,
              seen from different sides.

              The quasi-pantheistic sentiments which
              Kushner espouses have, at various times
              and places, surfaced within the tradition
              of Jewish mysticism (as Kushner
              himself is quick to point out), most recently
              within Hasidism. Generally, however,
              there was a quick return to less controversial
              theological formulations. In the
              case of Hasidism, which is most
              instructive in this regard, the backing-off was
              undoubtedly due in part to the vehemence
              of the opposition which the
              theological radicalism engendered. But it would
              be a mistake to suppose that the threats,
              denunciations and bans of excommunication
              issued by their opponents (called the
              Mitnaggedim) against the Hasidim were
              very effective in stemming the spread of
              the new revivalist movement. They were
              npt. Rather, the Hasidic movement imposed
              on itself a kind of internal censor-
              ship, recognizing that some of its
              opponents' more reasoned objections were
              in fact quite valid.

              The most sophisticated and respected
              critic of Hasidism was Hayyim Volozhiner
              (1749-1821), founder of the great
              Volozhiner Yeshiva and disciple of the
              famed Gaon of Vilna. It is notable that,
              in his classic work on Jewish theology
              and practice, Nefesh ha-Hayyim, he never
              denies the legitimacy of Hasidic teachings
              on divine immanence when judged
              from a purely theoretical perspective. On
              the contrary, he seems to wish to outdo
              the Hasidim in the extremity of his statements
              regarding the all-pervading nature
              of the divine Presence.

              There is, of course, a "but": whatever
              ultimate ontological validity the emphasis
              on divine immanence and radical monism
              may have, Hayyim tells us, Judaism is,
              after all, based on differentiation,
              distinction and boundaries — not the least of
              which is the boundary between God and
              humanity. If God has given us a Torah,
              and a world in which to fulfill it, God
              evidently did not want us to short-circuit
              the pathway to the divine perspective on
              reality, to the vision of undifferentiated
              Unity. In its subsequent historical
              development, Hasidism for the most part
              implicitly acceded to the validity of Hayyim's
              critique.

              THE RELEVANCE of this position
              for Kushner's book is clear: the
              vision he shares with us is indisputably
              attractive, but profoundly subversive of
              everyday human reality if held in focus
              for too long. The author himself points to
              the problem; toward the end of the book
              he warns the reader: "If the searcher
              chooses to remain with eternity, the
              searcher loses eternity! If the searcher
              chooses this finite world, the searcher is
              rewarded with eternity!" Yes, but what
              does it now mean to "choose this finite
              world"? The reader is presented with
              profound insights, but with little sense of
              how they can be integrated into his or
              her daily life in any concrete way.
              Once again, a glance at the history of
              Jewish mysticism is instructive. At the
              same time that the Kabbalah spoke of
              the Divine within, of the Primordial
              Adam in whose matrix we are formed, of
              the return back to Nothing, there was
              always an emphasis on praxis, on the
              necessity to follow a spiritual path full of
              effort and self-discipline. The work was
              arduous and involved an element of
              self-surrender. To have presented a vision of
              ultimate mystical reality without at the
              same time demanding from the devotee a
              total commitment and rigorous training
              would probably have struck the great
              Jewish mystics as being dangerous,
              frivolous or both.

              In its substitution of vicarious experience
              for the total personal involvement
              demanded by most spiritual disciplines,
              The River of Light is not really so far
              from American suburban culture as its
              author might suppose. Exploring the bed
              of Kushner's "river," one dredges up
              sedimentary layers deposited by
              successive cultural waves: the human potential
              movement, Jungian thought and transpersonal
              psychology, along with traces of
              Eastern mysticism (California vintage).
              With respect to Jewish practice in
              particular, Kushner in effect wishes to have
              his kuchel and eat it too: he would like
              to embrace only those elements of Jewish
              observance which seem appropriate to a
              postrationalist, quasi-mystical suburban
              culture, while rejecting the rest. In this
              approach, there is a place for mitzvah as
              celebration of Being but not as binding
              commandment.

              The River of Light reveals an
              extraordinarily gifted writer and religious
              thinker. Its author would probably
              acknowledge that he himself could not
              predict where the choices it opens up to the
              reader might lead. Recalling that the
              word "heresy" is derived from the Greek
              word for "choice," one may say that the
              book is indeed heretical. However, as
              Andre Suares once pointed out, there are
              no heresies in a dead religion. If nothing
              else, Lawrence Kushner's The River of
              Light demonstrates that Judaism is very
              much alive.
