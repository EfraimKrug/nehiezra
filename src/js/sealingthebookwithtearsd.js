        In sublime, heavy cadences, the Torah describes the end of the life of Moses.
        And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto mount Nebo, to the top
        of Pisga, that is over against Jericho. And the Lord showed him all the
        Land, even Gilead as far as Dan; and all Naphtali, and the land of
        Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah as far as the hinder
        sea. . . . And the Lord said unto him: “This is the land which I swore
        unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying: I will give it unto thy
        seed; I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes, but thou shalt not go
        thither.” So Moses the servant of the Lord died there in the land of
        Moab, according to the word of the Lord. And He buried him in the val-
        ley of the land of Moab. . . . And no person knows of his sepulchre unto
        this day. And Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died; his
        eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated. And the children of Israel
        wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days; and the days of weeping
        in the mourning for Moses were ended. . . . And there hath not arisen a
        prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face;
        in all the signs and wonders, which the Lord sent him to do in the land
        of Egypt . . . and in all the mighty hand, and in all the awesome deeds,
        which Moses wrought in the sight of all Israel. (Deut. 34:1–12)

        Near the beginning of the Pentateuch God forms the first human out of the
        dust of the earth and blows the breath of life into his nostrils (Gen. 2:7). The
        biblical narrative starts with God fashioning Adam by His own hands, vivify-
        ing—actually inflating—him by applying the divine mouth to His creature’s
        face. Now at the end of the Pentateuch, in Deuteronomy 34, God decommis-
        sions his most trusted servant in the privacy of Pisgah. The second half of
        verse 5, translated as “according to the word of the Lord,” reads in
        Hebrew al pi Adonai, literally “by the mouth of the Lord.” The Talmud under-
        stands this to mean that Moses was taken by a Divine kiss. In other words,
        God’s mouth once again touches the mouth of His creature—we can imagine
        the strength of the seal formed by that intimate contact—and God withdraws
        the breath He had emplaced long before. And just as God formed Adam with
        His own hands, so now does God return Moses to the earth in the same man-
        ner: “And He buried him in the valley of the land of Moab” (v. 6).<span className="SuperScript">2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;        <br/><br/>

        These last verses of the Torah are discussed in a passage of the Babylonian
        Talmud (b. Baba Batra 14b–15a; cf. b. Menahot 30a),<span className="SuperScript">3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;which asks, “Who wrote
        the Scriptures?” This crucial question, posed in such a disarmingly direct man-
        ner, sets off a long discussion of the books of the Bible. The passage begins with
        the statement that “Moses wrote his own book and the portion of Balaam and
        Job. Joshua wrote the book which bears his name and [the last] eight verses
        of the Pentateuch.” This last assertion is established by reference to Deuteron-
        omy 34:5, “So Moses the servant of the Lord died there.” “Now is it pos-
        sible that Moses while still alive<span className="SuperScript">4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;would have written the words, ‘Moses died
        there’? The truth is, however, that up to this point Moses wrote, from this point
        Joshua wrote.” This view, attributed to Rabbi Judah (or, according to another
        tradition, to Rabbi Nehemia), is challenged by Rabbi Simeon: “Can [we imag-
        ine the] scroll of the Torah being short of one word, and is it not written, Take
        this book of the Torah (Deut. 31:26)? No; what we must say is that up to this
        point the Holy One, blessed be He, dictated and Moses repeated and wrote,
        and from this point God dictated and Moses wrote in tears.”

        A troubling dilemma: If Moses wrote the last eight verses, then he appar-
        ently wrote an untruth, for Deuteronomy 34:5 could not have been accurate
        at the moment he was writing. But if Moses didn’t write the last verses, then
        the Torah scroll would have been incomplete and thus not a true Torah scroll.
        The paradox is deeper still when we reflect on verse 10: “And there hath
        not arisen a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the Lord
        knew face to face.” This verse underscores the uniqueness of the Mosaic
        prophecy and thus the primacy of the Pentateuch in the biblical canon.<span className="SuperScript">5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;For
        Jews, of course, the Pentateuch is the foundation and generative core of the en-
        tire Bible. These verses, placed at the culmination of the Pentateuchal narra-
        tive, serve to authenticate the whole book; they are its seal, the ground of its
        authority.<span className="SuperScript">6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;The suggestion that the last eight verses were written by Joshua,
        while straightforward and plausible, leaves Moses’ work unfinished when he
        <br/><br/>
        </div>
        <div className="PDFBody">
        died, with the all-important lines left out. What does it do to the primacy of
        Mosaic prophecy if it was a subsequent disciple, a lesser prophet, who made
        this very assertion?

        </div>
        <div className="PDFBody">
        The question gains troubling power when we note the astonishing sweep of
        “And there hath not arisen a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses.”
        This is a not a prospective statement that looks forward to a distant future but
        a retrospective statement, a categorical declaration spoken from a position of
        finality, of “last things,” sealing not only the Pentateuch but the entirety of
        prophetic activity in Judaism by espying all of history in its rear-facing view. In
        the vastness of its sweep it surely rivals Genesis’s “In the beginning God cre-
        ated . . .” Taken together, Genesis 1 and Deuteronomy 34 are bookends that
        frame the Pentateuch; they are the ultimate assertions of God-as-Omniscient-
        Narrator.<span className="SuperScript">7</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;        <br/><br/>

        That is not all. The last part of verse<span className="SuperScript">10</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;is also notable: “whom the Lord
        knew face to face.” Not that Moses knew God face-to-face—but that God
        knew Moses. In its focus on the singular quality of God’s connection to His
        servant, it goes beyond other passages such as Numbers 12:6–8, whose main
        concern is the unique character of Moses. Here the stress is the intimacy of the
        Divine knowing—yeda’o, using the same verb the early chapters of Genesis
        employ for carnal knowledge: “and Adam knew Eve his wife” (Gen. 4:1).<span className="SuperScript">8</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;        With the intensity of this spiritual eros, it is no wonder that (as our Talmud
        passage tells us) Moses deviated from scribal convention and did not repeat
        the words dictated to him.
        <br/><br/>
        </div>
        <div className="PDFBody">
        Jewish tradition largely settled on the view of Rabbi Simeon that Moses
        himself wrote the final verses as being more consistent with the special posi-
        tion of the Torah (“the Five Books of Moses”) in the biblical canon. But what
        about the problem of Moses writing of his death in the past tense? Commen-
        tators noted a striking ambiguity in the phrase, “Moses wrote in tears”: it could
        be understood to mean that Moses wept as he wrote; or that Moses wrote the
        words with tears—instead of ink.<span className="SuperScript">9</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;        <br/><br/>
        </div>
        <div className="PDFBody">
        The image of Moses weeping as he wrote has emotional poignancy but does
        not seem fully consistent with Moses’ character in the rest of the Pentateuch.
        Unlike Jacob, Moses does not weep when he meets his wife-to-be at the well
        (Exod. 2:15–21; cf. Gen. 29:11). When God threatens to destroy Israel in the
        aftermath of the Golden Calf episode and Moses insists that their sin be for-
        given, his steely defiance includes a cool invitation for God to “erase me from
        the book which You have written” (Exod. 32:32). So it is surprising that
        Moses would weep in self-pity at the inscription of his death. It is also sugges-
        tive that in Deuteronomy 34 itself, we are told that “the children of Israel
        wept for Moses” (v. 8); by contrast, “[Moses’] eye was undimmed” (v. 7).
        Since one consequence of weeping is a blurring of vision, a dimming of the
        eye, the statement that his eye was not dim actually suggests that as the end
        approached, Moses did not weep. For all these reasons, it is preferable to
        understand the Talmudic passage as meaning that Moses wrote the words with
        tears.
        <br/><br/>
        </div>
        <div className="PDFBody">
        One must imagine here a kind of scribal darkroom with time as the sacred
        fixative, so that the tears gradually turn into ink, disclosing their message after
        Moses had in fact died, thereby skirting the paradox: at the time he wrote in
        tears the message was not yet readable.<span className="SuperScript">10</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;The special character of the Torah as
        God’s word and yet “the Torah of Moses” is upheld.<span className="SuperScript">11</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;        <br/><br/>
        </div>
        <div className="PDFBody">
        But if Moses did not weep, whose tears are these, with which Moses wrote?
        In the death scene of last eight verses, there are after all two characters,
        Moses and God. Could the tears be not those of the servant but of the Master?
        The suggestion that the tears were God’s is less startling when we recall the
        importance of divine pathos in rabbinic thought. As Henry Slonimsky puts it,
        “The Midrashic imagination is unabashed and strips God of the usual pomp
        and power. . . . When the enemies had destroyed the Temple, . . . [w]e have
        a God in tears . . . refusing to be robbed of the supreme prerogative of the
        heart to weep and to suffer compassion.”<span className="SuperScript">12</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike later philosophical exposi-
        tions of Judaism, the Talmud and classical Midrashim are full of anthropo-
        morphic and anthropopathic imagery. For the Midrash (again quoting
        Slonimsky), “if anyone can be said to be in need of comfort it is God, not
        Israel.”<span className="SuperScript">13</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus it is entirely possible that the Talmud meant that God was
        weeping—for the loss of His most trusted servant and intimate friend.
        <br/><br/>
        </div>
        <div className="PDFBody">
        This possibility gains likelihood when we recall that the rabbis consistently
        portray the relationship between God and Moses as intimately personal,
        including an aspect of physical contact. In this they are following Scripture
        itself, with such passages as Exodus 33 and 34, where Moses asks God to show
        him His Glory, meaning His visible form. Working out a strategy for Moses to
        survive the experience, God puts Moses in the cleft of the rock and protects
        him with His palm. And as noted above, God Himself buries Moses. Expand-
        ing on this, the Talmud Sotah 13b describes how Moses was carried from the
        portion of Reuben to the portion of Gad, cradled in the wings of the Shekhinah,
        which Rashi explains to mean “in the flap of God’s Garment of Radiance.”<span className="SuperScript">14</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;        This intimate relationship is compared by the Midrash to that between hus-
        band and wife.<span className="SuperScript">15</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the intimacy of God’s direct contact with Moses plays a
        role in the rabbinic understanding of how Torah was given. We are told that
        Moses acquired his radiant countenance (beams of light: Exod. 34:29–35)
        while the Tablets were being passed from God’s hands to Moses’ hands.<span className="SuperScript">16</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;The
        Tablets were six handbreadths wide; God’s hands held two handbreadths,
        Moses’ hands held two, with two handbreadths of stone separating hand from
        Hand.<span className="SuperScript">17</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the residue of that brush with the Divine became the rays of light
        beaming out of Moses’ face.
        <br/><br/>
        </div>
        <div className="PDFBody">
        Michael Fishbane cites the early midrash Sifre Deuteronomy (343), which
        describes God’s word emerging as fire from His right hand, eventually inscrib-
        ing itself on the tablets of Moses. Fishbane notes that in the midrashic myth,
        “God’s word emerges from the divine essence as visible fire and takes instruc-
        tional shape as letters and words upon the tablets.”<span className="SuperScript">18</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;While that passage refers
        to the tablets, we are arguing that our Talmudic passage should be understood
        in a similar way: tears emerge from the divine self and, with the help of Moses,
        are inscribed upon the parchment of the first Torah scroll.
        <br/><br/>
        </div>
        <div className="PDFBody">
        Finally, the midrash Deuteronomy Rabbah on our passage makes God’s tears
        explicit: “God kissed Moses and took away his soul with a kiss of the mouth,
        and God, if one may say so, wept.”<span className="SuperScript">19</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;The only element added by the Talmudic
        passage in Baba Batra then would be that Moses used those divine tears to
        inscribe the last eight verses and defeat the paradox of a self-referential
        account of one’s death. Moses thus emerges as the exemplar of the human con-
        dition, the quintessential person whose life is sealed in the tears of others,
        whose achievement is only revealed in retrospect, after taking leave of the
        stage.
        <br/><br/>
        </div>
        <div className="PDFBody">
        Just as Moses stands revealed by the last verses of the Torah, so does God. If
        the tears are His, we discover that He, too, suffers. He grieves with His cre-
        ation, laments its pain, feels the anguish of its thwarted yearnings and unreal-
        ized visions.<span className="SuperScript">20</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;For to have made a creature out of the dust, even such a one as
        Moses, means to have scoped a compass of finitude. As noted above, the Torah
        begins with God’s handiwork exiled from the Garden, and it ends with His ser-
        vant gazing at the Promised Land from afar. The exile, the unfinished nature
        of the work, cannot but reflect on the Maker as well; in weeping for Moses,
        God acknowledges His own entanglement in what He has wrought. God is
        implicated in finitude and that awareness made tears flow—God’s own tears.
        And as God showed Moses the Land from the top of Pisgah, the Temple was
        still hundreds of years in the future, and its destruction hundreds of years
        beyond that, but it was all visible then and there. Who could not but weep?
        God wept at the death of His greatest prophet and most devoted servant. As
        the divine mouth sought out the mouth of the son of Amram, tears flowed
        from one face to the other face. “The Lord knew Moses”: a pouring of the self
        into the other, completing the other, thus completing the self. For the crown
        of Divine greatness is just this, that God suffers with His creatures, shedding
        tears: transcendence melting into finitude.
        <br/><br/>
        </div>
        <div className="PDFBody">
        The only God known to Jews is the God who has poured Himself onto
        parchment, who so loved His servant that He wept over that creature’s death
        and by weeping, disclosed His own implication in finitude.<span className="SuperScript">21</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tears are the only
        disclosing solvent for the Absolute.<span className="SuperScript">22</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;This, then, is the Torah’s coda, the sum-
        mit to which everything preceding has aimed. The capstone of the Torah is
        the Divine weeping, the Divine eulogy for Moses; it is God’s mourning the loss
        of His love relationship with Moses, thereby revealing the truth and power of
        that love for him and by extension for Israel and the world. How, after all,
        could the Torah—inscribing the wisdom of the Infinite One—end; how could
        it remain other than perpetually open? It could only be brought to closure by88
        those eight verses, signaling the Divine passion, the Divine engagement with
        Moses, the Divine willingness to be affected by humanity’s greatest exemplars
        and thus by all humanity.
        <br/><br/>
        </div>
        <div className="PDFBody">
        The power of the Talmudic reading emerges when we note that by its light,
        34:10 is self-referential. “And there hath not arisen a prophet since in Israel like
        unto Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face”—at that very moment, the moment
        of death. If the key to prophecy is relationship, never was the divine-human rela-
        tionship stronger than when mouth pressed against mouth, when vital ocular
        fluid flowed from the Holy Ancient One onto the face of the servant, running
        down his beard, down his robe, like the dew of Hermon, onto the scroll: for there
        God ordained blessing. A death that was life for evermore. The last eight verses,
        and by extension the entire Torah, become a completion cycle and a love letter.
        And it is just this secret of divine weeping that explains how Moses could
        have written those final verses. For how could even the most humble of men
        write “And there hath not arisen a prophet since in Israel like unto
        Moses” with equanimity? Only by focusing on God’s emotions, not his own.
        Had Moses wept, his writing would have drowned in a sea of self-regard and
        subjectivity. It was his contemplation of God’s weeping that enabled him to
        transcend the natural tendency to human subjectivity and to complete the
        work from God’s perspective—that is, to write the Five Books of Moses as
        sacred scripture, as the cornerstone of everything that is to come in Judaism.
        The tradition of ascribing profound emotions to God was largely neglected or
        suppressed by the medieval Jewish philosophers. Such great thinkers as Mai-
        monides conceived of God as pure intellect; it followed that the only way to
        approach the divine was by cultivating one’s intellect at the expense of other
        aspects of the human psyche. These tendencies were to some degree balanced
        and corrected by the flourishing of the Kabbalah, but the full return of the
        personal, passionate God of the Bible, Talmud, and Midrash awaited the Ha-
        sidic movement in the eighteenth century. Hasidism promoted devekut—
        “communion with God”—as a central religious value. In some Hasidic circles
        devekut was understood as loss of ego, the individual self merging with the
        Absolute. But alongside this tendency there was also a personalistic under-
        standing of God, who bore close resemblance to the deity of Tanakh and clas-
        sic Aggadah, and who could be approached by the individual hasid in prayer
        and other modes of devoted relationship. In the tales and folk traditions of the
        movement, the mode of dialogic intimacy held a far more prominent place
        than that of acosmism and merging with the Absolute, but it must be under-
        stood that part of the genius of Hasidism is that the two approaches were seen
        to complement rather than conflict with each other.
        <br/><br/>
        </div>
        <div className="PDFBody">
        Alongside devekut, another keyword in Hasidism is hitkashrut—“bonding.”
        What devekut describes for the hasid in relation to God, hitkashrut portrays for
        the relationship between the hasid and the master, known as the rebbe or zad-
        <br/><br/>
        </div>
        <div className="PDFBody">
        dik. The ideal is for the rebbe and hasid to bond soul to soul, heart to heart, des-
        tiny to destiny. The bonding is mutual and reciprocal: the hasid bonds himself
        to the rebbe and the rebbe to hasid; but the hasid also bonds himself to that
        which the rebbe holds dear. Through attachment to the rebbe, even the sim-
        plest hasid is in touch with God, Torah, and the Hasidic community.
        The story of the growth and spread of Hasidism throughout Eastern Europe
        has been told elsewhere; our concern here is to suggest that for all the com-
        plexity and diversity of Hasidic spirituality, the inner life of the movement
        might be grasped by focusing on the two themes of devekut and hitkashrut:
        bonding to God, to the rebbe, and the community of fellow hasidim.
        With this emphasis in mind we might approach the master who penned the
        final work of Hasidic teachings in Poland, Rabbi Kalonymos Kalmish Shapiro
        (1889–1943).<span className="SuperScript">23</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Known as the Rebbe of Piaseczno, he was a multifaceted per-
        sonality who served as leader to an intellectual elite as well as to the desper-
        ately poor common folk of interwar Poland. Famed as a pedagogue and
        educational theorist, he was also celebrated for his knowledge of medicine. In
        the Warsaw Ghetto, as Polish Jewry went through its death agony, Rabbi
        Shapiro continued to teach, to lead, to give material and spiritual support, and
        finally to show how it is possible to maintain a radiant faith in the midst of the
        deepest darkness and despair. His last book, which he referred to as “Torah
        insights from the years of wrath 5700–5702 [1939–1942],” was among the
        manuscripts he buried in 1943, shortly before the complete destruction of
        the ghetto. The manuscript was discovered after the war and was eventually
        published in Israel under the title Esh Kodesh (Fire of holiness). Composed dur-
        ing a time of utter personal crisis and communal devastation, after he had
        already lost most of his family, it is the last work of Hasidism written in Poland.<span className="SuperScript">24</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;        <br/><br/>
        </div>

        The great theme of Esh Kodesh is weeping—divine weeping. Rabbi Shapiro
        revisits the aggadic passages on God’s tears and through them finds a language
        to address his community in faithfulness and integrity. The theme of divine
        suffering enables him to rise above the most likely, understandable response:
        the silence of collapse and despair. It also allows him to avoid the platitudes of
        theodicy, to avoid sounding notes that (no matter how holy) would not have
        rung true in that time and place. Instead, he embraces the midrashic image of
        God weeping alone in His Inner Chambers, and avers that the hasid can push
        in, join his tears with God’s, communing with God in suffering, just as at hap-
        pier times we commune with God in shared joy.

        As he wrote in March 1942, shortly before the destruction of the Warsaw
        Ghetto:
        God, blessed be He, is to be found in His inner chambers weeping, so that one
        who pushes in and comes close to Him by means of studying Torah, weeps
        together with God, and studies Torah with Him. Just this makes the difference:
        the weeping, the pain which a person undergoes by himself, alone, may have the90
        effect of breaking him, of bringing him down, so that he is incapable of doing any-
        thing. But the weeping which the person does together with God—that strength-
        ens him. He weeps—and is strengthened; he is broken—but finds courage to study
        and teach. It is hard to raise one’s self up, time and again, from the tribulations,
        but when one is determined, stretching his mind to connect to the Torah and
        Divine service, then he enters the Inner Chambers where the Blessed Holy One
        is to be found; he weeps and wails together with Him, as it were, and even finds
        the strength to study Torah and serve Him.<span className="SuperScript">25</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;        <br/><br/>

        What matters most for Rabbi Shapiro and for Hasidism is relationship.
        Relationship with the other, compassion for the other, suffering with the other
        is itself a kind of redemption. For what is redemption if not the finding of our
        most fully human self, in the act of imitatio Dei? It is not just that God suffers
        with us, for us, because we suffer, but that God is most God when He suffers;
        He comes most into Himself when He identifies with Israel, with her human-
        ity, her vulnerability, her personal and collective destiny. Similarly, we become
        most like God when we transcend our own suffering, when we participate in
        the suffering of others and in the suffering of God. Because God is God, He
        suffers most intensely, infinitely; His suffering must remain hidden. But
        because God remains God, He also remains the hope for redemption in a con-
        crete sense. Because humans are human, they do not decide when or how to
        end their suffering or to claim to know its meaning. But, because humans are
        human, they can arouse themselves, take hold of inner, hidden resources—in
        other words, grasp their faith—and thereby hope to arouse God to once again
        announce His redemptive presence in a world that still awaits Him.

        The tears Rabbi Shapiro shed for his own family and community, for
        humanity, for God, fell on sheets of paper and emerged as words of Torah,
        words of Hasidism. They brought to a close a period that had begun two hun-
        dred years earlier, a period and movement that signaled hope to the Jews of
        Eastern Europe and a rebirth of religious creativity for Judaism as a whole.
        Hasidism was miraculously revived after the war in new forms, but the prewar
        world will never return. Marking the end of one era, Rabbi Shapiro’s words,
        and tears, are now being recovered for inspiration and faith in another.
        Were those tears his own, or God’s?

        Moses dipped his quill into the sacred tears and wrote the last verses of the
        Torah, sealing his life and his book in the only manner it could be sealed, with
        the divine ocular fluid, the viscosity of which formed the letters so that the
        story could be told and made available for those yet to come, yet to appear on
        the loom of time, to face joy and sadness and joy again, comforted now by the
        human examples of such as Moses himself, facing the end and thus transcend-
        ing it, facing the other weeping Face, in the work of compassion that must
        come to closure but is always open.

        My understanding of Levinas’s thought and its relevance to the theme of this essay
        have been greatly enhanced by conversations with Dr. Jacob Meskin, to whom I
        express my sincere thanks. The original impetus for this essay came from Professor
        Kimberley Patton, who also graciously provided much guidance and encouragement
        along the way. I am deeply grateful for her help and her friendship, now and through
        the years.

        1. My translation of Deuteronomy 34 is based on that of J. H. Hertz in his Pentateuch
        and Haftorahs, 2nd ed. (London: Soncino Press, 1988), 915–17, with some modifi-
        cations, notably in verse 6, where Hertz has, “And he was buried in the valley of
        the land of Moab,” using the passive voice (against the Hebrew), no doubt to avoid the
        anthropomorphism.

        2. The ring structure linking God’s compassion for Adam in Genesis with his care
        for Moses in Deuteronomy is noted in b. Sotah 14a, the Talmudic passage enjoining
        human imitation of God’s compassionate acts: “Rabbi Simlai expounded: Torah begins
        with an act of benevolence and ends with an act of benevolence. It begins with an act
        of benevolence, for it is written, And the Lord God made for Adam and for his
        wife coats of skin, and He clothed them (Gen. 3:21); and it ends with an act of
        benevolence, for it is written, and He buried him in the valley (Deut. 34:6).”

        3. This passage sets out the proper sequence of the biblical books when copied on a
        single scroll. It has been the subject of scrutiny by scholars interested in the formation
        of the biblical canon. See Sid Z. Leiman, The Canonization of Hebrew Scripture: The Tal-
        mudic and Midrashic Evidence (Hamden, CT: Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sci-
        ences, 1976); Louis Jacobs, Structure and Form in the Babylonian Talmud (New York:

        4. Following the version in b. Menahot 30a, Baba Batra has “having died.” While the
        point is the same with either reading, we follow the Menahot version because it high-
        lights the problem with greater clarity. Our aggadah as found in the Babylonian Talmud
        is a much expanded exposition of an earlier midrashic theme. Compare the earlier Sifre
        on Deuteronomy, ed. Louis Finkelstein (New York: Jewish Theological Seminary of
        America, 1969), 427.

        5. See b. Ta’anit 9a: “Is there anything in the Sacred Writings to which allusion can-
        not be found in the Torah?” Rashi ad loc.: “Moses [alluded to all Scripture] in the
        Torah, for the Pentateuch is the foundation of the Prophets and the Hagiographa, and
        a support for every [verse] can be found in the Torah.”

        6. This verse recalls others that emphasize the uniqueness of Moses and his prophecy
        such as Numbers 12:8; cf. also Exodus 14:31, 19:9, 20:18, 33:11. But its placement at
        the end of the Torah clearly elevates its rhetorical moment; it is the Torah’s coda, its
        final comment on Moses and itself.

        Sternberg cites our Baba Batra Talmudic passage, his approach to it is less than fully sat-
        isfying in my view, and this essay unfolds along a different path. Jeffrey H. Tigay, “The

        8. Cf. Dennis T. Olson, Deuteronomy and the Death of Moses (Minneapolis: Fortress
        Press, 1994), 169: “To ‘know’ another person in Hebrew denotes an intimate relation-
        ship. To know ‘face to face’ pushes the level of intimacy even higher, straining to
        express near parity or equality.” Olson’s theological approach to Deuteronomy, while
        focusing on the biblical text without the Talmudic reading, is remarkably consistent
        with the perspective we are developing here.

        55a–56a in Ein Ya’akov anthology of Talmudic aggadah, ed. Romm [Vilna: Romm, 1912]).
        10. The Gaon of Vilna proposes another approach leading to much the same result:
        Moses wrote the letters of the last eight verses but all jumbled together, not separated
        into words. Only after he died were the letters arranged by Joshua in the format we now
        have, disclosing their semantic content. This view of the Gaon of Vilna is quoted
        by Rabbi Hanokh Zundel ben Yosef, Anaf Yosef on Ein Ya’akov (Vilna: Romm, 1912),
        Baba Batra 15 (55b in the Ein Ya’akov pagination).

        22–40. Relevant to our theme is Fishbane’s observation that “a spiritual eros animates
        midrashic exegesis” (19). See also David Stern, Midrash and Theory: Ancient Jewish Exe-
        gesis and Contemporary Literary Studies (Evanston: Northwestern University Press,

        Reading Gender in Talmudic Aggadah,” Nashim: A Journal of Jewish Women’s Studies
        and Gender Issues 4 (2001): 56–83, argues convincingly that the rabbinic self-image
        needed to include tears—stereotypically associated with the feminine—in its under-
        standing of the creative emergence of Oral Torah in the Bet Midrash. Her argument is
        consistent with the approach taken here, with God in the role of weeper, giving birth
        to the Written Torah.

        14. For an earlier instance, see b. Sotah 11a, commenting on Exodus 2:4, “And his
        sister stood at a distance, to know what would befall him.” The Talmudic aggadah
        explains “sister” not to mean Miriam but rather the Shekhinah—God’s manifest Pres-
        ence. God in the guise of the protective older sister stands watch over baby Moses in
        the bulrushes.

        15. Midrash Debarim Rabbah, ed. Saul Lieberman, 2nd ed. (Jerusalem: Shalem

        Moses, the man of God . . .” The passage hangs on a wordplay on the Hebrew ish,
        which can mean “husband” as well as “man.” Note that the midrash has Moses as the
        ish—the husband, with God as the obedient wife—a startling idea indeed.

        19. Deuteronomy Rabbah 11:6 (end). Note also the striking passage in Sifra, an
        early halakhic midrash from the school of Rabbi Akiva, on Leviticus 1:1, which uses
        erotic language to describe the intromission of the Divine Glory into the space
        between the Cherubim, in order to utter the Word. This midrashic passage is particu-
        larly relevant to our theme in that it goes on to say that while humans may not see God
        in life, they may see Him “at their death.”

        20. The classic rabbinic text of divine participation in human suffering is the Mish-
        nah at b. Sanhedrin 46a: “Rabbi Meir said, When a human suffers, what expression does
        the Shekhinah use?—‘My head is too heavy for me; my arm is too heavy for me.’” The
        human referred to is a criminal executed for a capital offense. The Mishnah concludes,
        “And if God is so grieved for the blood of the wicked that is shed, how much more so
        over the blood of the righteous!” Notable on this passage is the comment of Rashi at b.
        Hagigah 15b, s.v. Kalani me-roshi [My head is too heavy for me]: “my arm is too heavy
        for me, for I have created this individual who died on account of his sin” (emphasis added).
        That is, God grieves for the failure of His creature, a failure that necessarily implicates
        Him as well.
