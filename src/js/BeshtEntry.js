          Israel ben Eliezer (ca. 1698–1760), better known as
          “Baal Shem Tov” (meaning “Master of the Good
          Name”), was a charismatic teacher of a Jewish
          mystical path of ecstatic
          devotion who inspired a revivalist movement later
          called Hasidism. While there
          is very little extant written material reliably assigned
          to the Baal Shem Tov, both the traditions
          handed down by family members and disciples and,
          in particular, the many quotations found in the
          works of his student Rabbi Jacob Joseph of Polonnoye
          provide a stable and consistent portrait of his
          spiritual approach and mode of biblical interpretation.
          This portrayal is especially evident since Jacob
          Joseph’s own writings are prolix and labyrinthine,
          while the Baal Shem Tov citations are invariably
          short and epigrammatic. His scriptural readings
          and rabbinic interpretations come as illuminative
          flashes, aphoristic bursts which typically involve
          rephrasing, reparsing, and shifting of cadences. A
          central ideal is integration of all aspects of the self,
          including those perceived to be undesirable, into a
          spirituality that caps but does not replace the
          physical. In this vein, Eccl 9 : 10 is read to mean
          “Whatsoever your hand finds to do, do it with all your
          mindful awareness.” Non-dualism is achieved when
          the person simultaneously manifests thought and
          deed, mind and action, spirit and body, linking but
          not collapsing the various states. Inhabiting the
          linkage engenders a kind of apotheosis which
          channels blessing and unlocks power. Closely related to
          this conception is the Baal Shem Tov’s understanding of
          Prov 3 : 6, “In all your ways acknowledge
          Him,” heard as a call not to recognize God merely
          in all aspects of life, but in all levels of one’s being:
          holistically integrating one’s corporeal and spiritual
          sides, so that their respective yearnings are satisfied
          not just serially or even in tandem, but in a mindful
          embrace of their totality, an inhabitation of the unified Self.

          The spiritual life must involve pleasure. Job
          19 : 26, “I would behold God while still in my
          flesh,” is read to mean that corporeal life, including
          sexuality, is emblematic for spiritual life. “Just as
          in physical union, one cannot have a child except if
          one has intercourse with an erect [‘living’] member,
          with desire and joy, so it is with spiritual union,
          with words of Torah and prayer. When one engages
          in them with a living body, with joy and pleasure,
          then the words bear fruit ...”

          As Gershom Scholem has pointed out, the Baal
          Shem Tov had an astonishing ability to imbue simple
          words with fresh significance and surprising
          resonances. For example, he would routinely take
          the Hebrew word for the numeral one, eh ø ad, and
          recontextualize it from an ordinary number into a
          charged signifier of mystical unity. With this trope,
          the wide-ranging diversity of the Torah’s teachings
          could be traced back to an essential unity. The
          teacher/interpreter, however, must himself be
          rooted in that unity; an individual of divided spirit
          will only see fragmentation and divisiveness. By
          contrast, a teacher in touch with the One can discover
          and unleash endlessly positive implications
          and repercussions.

          An important theme is the sublimation of evil
          and its transformation into good. Exod 14 : 10,
          “Pharaoh drew near,” is understood as “Pharaoh
          drew us near [to God].” Pharaoh’s pursuit of the
          Israelites at the exodus thus moved them to prayer
          (“and the children of Israel cried out unto the
          Lord”). By extension, any apparent menace can become
          a spur to closeness to God. Similarly, a slight
          shift of cadence in Ps 34 : 15, “Depart from evil, and
          do good,” yields “transform the evil into good.”
          Ps 92 : 10, “all evildoers shall be scattered,” is a
          recurrent trope in the teaching of the Baal Shem
          Tov, used to describe the sublimation of evil,
          achieved in two stages. Since all evil is illusion,
          rectification happens through an act of revisioning.

          Recognizing the positive aspect of evil elevates it,
          bringing it back to the light. Then follows the
          dissipation of one’s initial puzzlement and
          incomprehension. The illusion – the “evildoers,” or more
          literally the “workers of iniquity” – are not so much
          destroyed as “scattered,” that is, dissipated. The
          positive spark is returned, restored to the good,
          while the “negative” aspect, the illusion itself,
          dissolves to transparency.

          Governing all biblical interpretation, indeed all
          religious activity, is the goal of devequt, ecstatic
          communion with the divine, understood as entry into
          the pronounced letters of the Hebrew alphabet, as
          the practitioner creates a “sonic Ark” from his vocal
          articulation of sacred texts.

          For the Baal Shem Tov, the spiritual integrity
          of the interpreter is more important than
          intellectual skill or knowledge of the canon. Every word of
          the Torah can be taken in a positive or negative
          aspect, and the true teacher is charged with the
          mandate of bringing the letters and words to the side
          of good and blessing, comprehending the text in
          the most beneficent way. The interpreter is active,
          performative: his understanding shapes the text,
          the words, the very letters – which are living
          personalities – and brings them home.

          The Baal Shem Tov powerfully influenced all
          Hasidic exegesis, which further developed the
          insights and tropes he introduced. More
          fundamentally, he emboldened subsequent Hasidic masters to
          expound scripture with fluidity and suppleness,
          against the grain, prizing the aperçu that
          defamiliarized, startled, and ultimately led to a new awakening.
