      The lives of great mystics seem always to be shrouded in mystery, so
      scholarly biographies of these individuals are beset with methodolog-
      ical hurdles. The very factors that contribute to the interest and
      importance of mystical leaders—charismatic attraction, paranormal
      powers, and the like—leave behind a veil of unclarity that makes
      assessment of historical evidence more difficult than usual. These
      issues have beset attempts to reconstruct the figure of the founder of
      Hasidism, Israel ben Eliezer, known as the Baal Shem Tov. The
      appearance of Immanuel Etkes’s The Besht: Magician, Mystic, and Leader
      is thus a cause for celebration, for Etkes, a highly regarded Israeli
      historian, has produced a study of the Baal Shem Tov which is
      methodologically sound, firmly grounded on historical evidence, and—
      most importantly—succeeds in bringing the personality of this mystical
      leader to life.

      As the title indicates, Etkes’s portrait focuses on three main areas
      of the work of the Baal Shem Tov (often abbreviated to ‘Besht’):
      magician, mystic and leader. Under the first rubric, Etkes discusses the
      Baal Shem Tov as a practitioner of applied kabbalah, that is, an adept
      at theurgic use of divine Names. This is perhaps the most well-known
      aspect of the Besht’s activities, hardly unique to Israel ben Eliezer but
      shared with a number of other baalei shem of this historical period.
      However, Etkes points to the decisive element of personal charisma in
      the case of the Besht. As Etkes writes, the Besht’s charisma ‘‘was
      expressed through such near-prophetic powers such as the ability to
      see from afar, to tell futures, to discover a soul’s previous incarnations,
      and so forth.’’ (p. 78) While some of these powers may have been
      shared by other baalei shem, ‘‘we do not know of any baal shem to
      whom so full a range of traits could be attributed.’’ (Ibid.)
      As a leader, the Baal Shem Tov saw himself as ‘‘bearing
      responsibility for the Jewish people as a whole.’’ (p. 79) In the face
      of attacks from outside the Jewish community and social tensions

      within, the Besht defended the interests of Jews and worked to
      enhance their economic and religious situation. While much of this
      activity involved relatively conventional leadership efforts, some of it
      involved heavenly intercession in the pattern of a biblical prophet.
      On celestial journeys, the Besht intervened to save individual souls,
      and attempted to avert calamities threatening the Jewish people.
      In these activities he meets and converses with various extraordinary
      figures such as the Messiah and even Satan. By his own account, the
      Besht’s intercessory efforts were not always successful, and skeptics
      would naturally dismiss these episodes as pious fantasy and delusion.
      But the point is that the Besht believed in his own cosmic role and
      heavenly influence, and his disciples did as well. As Etkes shows, the
      image of the Baal Shem Tov as concerned and confident intercessor
      for Jews in both the terrestrial and supernal realms was decisive for
      the development of Hasidism, and nurtured the ideal of the hasidic
      zaddik in later generations.

      <div className="PDFBody">
      Etkes’s depiction of the Besht as mystic is particularly strong.
      Placing ecstatic prayer at the center of the Besht’s religious life, Etkes
      argues that dvekut (union with God) was an experience that permeated
      the Besht’s outlook at all times. While ecstasy, involving involuntary
      shaking of the body, was by nature brief and episodic, it nevertheless
      colored the Besht’s view of reality, since it was the experiential
      correlate to the doctrine of Divine immanence and the presence of
      God in all things. The Besht’s Dvekut was an experience of intense
      pleasure which undergirded his robust affirmation of the world as
      permeated with divinity, his confident embrace of the physical, and his
      denial that evil had independent metaphysical reality.

      <div className="PDFBody">
      Not only does Etkes provide vivid portrayals of the three major
      domains of the Besht’s functioning, he convincingly demonstrates how
      the three areas nurtured and reinforced each other. Because the Baal
      Shem Tov was a successful applied kabbalist, he had reason to travel
      widely, visiting many communities and meeting individuals of all
      stations. With an intimate knowledge of the Jewish world of his day,
      he was aware of the problems Jews faced and was well positioned to
      serve in a leadership role. Similarly, his charismatic powers gave him
      the self-confidence and fearlessness necessary for bold spiritual
      innovation. And there was a deeply emotional aspect to the Besht’s
      personality. His feeling for common folk and identification with the
      suffering of his fellow Jews, individually and collectively, spurred him
      to utilize his charismatic powers for the benefit of his people.
      The recent tendency in historiography has been to downplay the
      narrative of crisis which earlier historians once used to help explain
      Hasidism’s emergence. Current thinking emphasizes Polish Jewry’s
      rather quick recovery from the Chmielnicki massacres, the robustnessReview
      of its economic life, and even the relative security of its political
      situation. While Etkes is surely aware of this trend, he reverts to the
      earlier approach. Thus he writes that ‘‘The backdrop for the Besht’s
      labors on behalf of the Jewish people was the bleak social and political
      reality of Jewish life in the eighteenth century.’’ This included blood-
      libels, Heidemak massacres, outbreaks of plague, economic upheavals,
      the threat of the antinomian Frankists and even the burning of the
      Talmud. (p. 110) Etkes’s renewed foregrounding of the dangers
      besetting the community allows him to highlight the significance of
      the Besht’s career, instilling hope and comfort and a sense that Jewish
      interests were being championed and protected by a figure of true
      stature and courage.

      In returning to the emphasis on early Hasidism as a response to
      crisis, Etkes’s presentation must be contrasted with another important
      study of the Baal Shem Tov, Moshe Rosman’s Founder of Hasidism:
      A Quest for the Historical Ba’al Shem Tov. 1 Based on breakthrough work
      in Polish archives, Rosman asserts that the Jews of the Besht’s
      geographic region ‘‘were suffering neither mass poverty nor mass
      melancholia.’’ 2 And the Baal Shem Tov was not an outsider struggling
      against ossified communal structures. As Rosman puts it, ‘‘the Besht
      was much more a representative and perpetuator of existing religious,
      social, political, and even economic realities than he was an innovator.
      He certainly was no rebel against the establishment, whether religious
      or social.’’ 3 Rosman is keen to show the Besht as ‘‘a person of
      his time.’’
      <br/><br/>
      </div>
      <div className="PDFBody">
      While Etkes agrees with much of this, he nevertheless portrays
      the Besht in bolder strokes. He also has a more positive opinion of
      the historicity of Shivhei Habesht, a collection of hagiographic tales
      about the Baal Shem Tov and his circle, first published in 1814. In
      contrast to Rosman’s skepticism, Etkes notes that details of these
      stories have been corroborated in external sources. Although
      published decades after the death of its subject, this collection
      mentions episodes and facts that can now be verified by archival
      discoveries; therefore, Etkes concludes, ‘‘many stories collected in the
      book Shivhei Habesht reflect the genuine historical experiences of the
      Besht and his associates.’’ (p. 223) And in contrast to some of his
      fellow historians, Etkes does not dismiss the accounts of paranormal
      phenomena out of hand. He writes, ‘‘it is not the historian’s business
      to establish whether the Besht indeed was endowed with the powers
      of prophecy and far-sightedness. What the historian is to do is to
      determine whether these abilities of the Besht played a substantial part
      in how he perceived himself, in how his associates viewed him, and
      perforce also in the relations formed between him and those who
      surrounded him.’’ (p. 223)232

      To augment his portrait, Etkes makes use of the published
      homilies and sermons of the Besht’s disciples, notably the writings of
      Rabbi Jacob Joseph of Polonne. Once again there is a contrast
      between Etkes and Rosman, who asserts that ‘‘the possibility of
      connecting with the Besht the sayings cited in the Besht’s name in
      Jacob Joseph of Polonne’s books is very small.’’ 4 Etkes uses the teach-
      ings of the Baal Shem Tov to construct a convincing intellectual
      portrait of Hasidism’s founder, for example on the key topic of avodah
      be-gashmiyyut, that is, robust affirmation of this physical world, with its
      joys and pleasures, as a worthy vehicle for sacred service. His
      willingness to use tales and teachings as well as archival materials
      enables Etkes to triangulate his portrayal, each source serving to
      enrich, complement and correct the others. What emerges is a three-
      dimensional, multi-hued picture of a genuine illuminate. All this leads
      to Etkes’s conclusion that Israel ben Eliezer was indeed the founder of
      Hasidism, even though the rise of an organized movement took place
      after his death. This is because the Besht’s charisma, paranormal
      powers, teachings on ecstatic prayer and serving God with joy were
      the centerpieces of the spiritual lives of his disciples such as Rabbi Dov
      Ber the maggid of Mezerich, Rabbi Jacob Joseph of Polonne, and
      other leaders of great stature. The early disciple circle cherished
      their master’s life and teachings and lived their lives energized by the
      inspiration of his person, and sought to share that inspiration with
      others. So the question of whether ‘‘the Besht set in motion a process
      that ultimately resulted in the launching of Hasidism as a movement’’
      (p. 5) is answered in the affirmative.

      Immanuel Etkes has set a solid and lasting foundation for further
      work on the Baal Shem Tov and early Hasidism. One open line of
      research is to continue the analysis of the Beshtian teachings as cited
      in the writings of disciples, especially Rabbi Jacob Joseph of Polonne.
      I believe that careful textual work can distinguish the teachings of the
      Baal Shem Tov from that of his earnest follower. This is especially so
      because the voices are so different. Rabbi Jacob Joseph was immensely
      learned, and it shows on every page of his published works. But the
      labyrinthine intricacy and dense complexity of his own teachings
      contrast sharply with the lapidary brilliance of the Baal Shem Tov’s
      insights. The Besht’s scriptural apercus arrive in a flash, capturing
      the blaze of sacred words in stop-motion freeze-frame. Rabbi Jacob
      Joseph actually did a good job of preserving his master’s aphoristic
      style along with his mystical insights, and further research in this area
      promises to be richly rewarding.

      Aramaic. For example, the famous aphorism of Tikkunei Zohar, ‘‘Leyt
      atar panui mineih,’’ is a main source for hasidic views on divine
      immanence and omnipresence. The translation ‘‘no site is clear of
      him’’ (p. 135 and elsewhere) betrays the influence of modern Hebrew
      and misses the sense of the Zoharic Aramaic. And the prophet
      Ezekiel’s chariot-vision has a phrase that became central in early
      Hasidism, ve-ha-hayyot ratzo va-shov (Old JPS: ‘‘And the living creatures
      ran and returned’’; Ez. 1:14). Early hasidic writers adopted a creative
      misreading, as if the Hebrew was ve-ha-hiyyut ratzo va-shov, meaning,
      ‘‘the spiritual vitality ran and returned.’’ This yields the idea that
      ecstatic experiences could not endure constantly; their nature was to
      ebb and flow. The reader would be hard-put to grasp this from the
      English translation, however, which renders, ‘‘and the animals run and
      return.’’ (p. 135)

      Immanuel Etkes has immeasurably enriched the study of Jewish
      mysticism with his landmark work on the Baal Shem Tov. It shows
      what can be done when all the available sources are used judiciously,
      responsibly, and with great insight and sensitivity. It points the way
      for further studies on the personalities and ideas of early Hasidism,
      and helps to explain why this seminal movement continues to flourish
      and surprise observers until the present day.
