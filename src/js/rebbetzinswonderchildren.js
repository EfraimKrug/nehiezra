            The institution of the tsaddik and the lineal inheritance of the position
            of tsaddik are considered perhaps the most characteristic features of the
            social structure of Hasidism. Yet while the theology of the tsaddik and
            his role are discussed at length in Hasidic theoretical literature, the
            dynastic principle is seldom discussed—or even mentioned—in Hasidic
            derashot (sermons, or discourses). Similarly, while the emergence of the
            Hasidic dynasties has been duly noted in scholarly studies, the reasons
            for that emergence have never been fully explained. In a recently repub-
            lished group of essays, Joseph Dan has underscored the centrality of the
            institution of the tsaddik for understanding Hasidism; according to
            Dan, it is the only really new feature of the movement as a whole.<span className="SuperScript">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>
            </div>
            <div className="PDFBody">

            After the first few decades of the movement’s existence, the tsaddik’s
            charismatic leadership became hereditary, so that “the tzaddik is a mira-
            cle worker both because of his charismatic relationship with the divine
            world and because of his being a descendant of great magicians like the
            Besht or the Maggid.”<span className="SuperScript">2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually, the charismatic element dwindled,
            and entitlement to leadership became “genetic, rather than an intellec-
            tual or spiritual.”<span className="SuperScript">3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dan characterizes hereditary leadership as “legitimate,
            organic, and central”<span className="SuperScript">4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;to the movement, yet he cannot entirely hide his

            puzzlement with this “stupendous phenomenon,”<span className="SuperScript">5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;which “introduced
            into Jewish culture the oxymoron of a hereditary charismatic leader and
            miracle worker.”<span className="SuperScript">6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dan argues persuasively that the main factor securing
            the miraculous contemporary rebirth of Hasidic communities in the
            aftermath of the Holocaust and other recent crises was “adherence to
            their hereditary tzaddikim.”<span className="SuperScript">7</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;But this does not shed light on how the
            principle took hold originally, well over a century before the challenges
            of the twentieth century. Following in the footsteps of many earlier
            researchers, Dan explores the historical and theological roots of the
            institution of the tsaddik: the relationship to Sabbateanism, the media-
            tion between heaven and earth, the responsibility of the tsaddik to
            channel blessings to his community, and so on. But nowhere does Dan
            explain why this theology required “the establishment of hereditary
            leadership in the people of Israel after almost a millenium of its
            absence.”<span className="SuperScript">8</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>

            In her now-classic essay “Hasidism after 1772: Structural Continuity
            and Change,”<span className="SuperScript">9</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ada Rapaport-Albert demonstrates that in the earliest
            period—the era of the Baal Shem Tov (d. 1760) and the Maggid of
            Mezhirech (d. 1772)—there was no dynastic principle at all. Rather,
            Hasidism began as a “loose association of autonomous units,” and no
            thought was given to the inheritance of leadership. Indeed, the Maggid of
            Mezhirech, a charismatic figure of enormous power and stature, actively
            worked to promulgate Hasidism as a decentralized movement, with no
            thought of bequeathing a unified body of followers to his own biological
            heir.<span className="SuperScript">10</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Following Shmuel Ettinger’s observation that “[The Maggid] set up
            group after group with a pupil at the head of almost every one,” Rapaport-
            Albert concludes that the Maggid worked actively to establish courts in
            different centers—led by disciples, not descendents.<span className="SuperScript">11</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>
            </div>
            <div className="PDFBody">

            So how and why did the principle of dynastic succession take hold?
            Rapaport-Albert suggests that this mode of organization arose to preserve
            the distinctive identities of the various schools after the death of the
            founder.<span className="SuperScript">12</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;But this suffers from circularity: if, as Rapaport-Albert amply
            demonstrates, Hasidism began as a fraternity of leaders and followers
            loosely bound together by a distinctive set of religious practices and theo-
            logical teachings, why could the movement not have continued on that
            basis? And if various schools developed as the movement grew and
            matured, why could not the “distinctive identity” of a school be preserved
            by a gifted disciple as well or better than by a son? Later in the same essay
            Rapaport-Albert suggests that the Polish-Russian pattern of inheritance of
            noble estates may have served as a model.<span className="SuperScript">13</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is indeed quite plausible,
            but we would still need to understand what internal forces arose within
            Hasidism at this time which made the aristocratic model appear attractive
            and legitimate. Rapaport-Albert poses the problem with admirable clarity:
            “The matter has not been addressed by scholars, but the institutionaliza-
            tion of the hereditary principle in both tsaddikism and hasidism should
            not be taken as self-explanatory.”<span className="SuperScript">14</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>
            </div>
            <div className="PDFBody">

            In point of fact, the move to hereditary succession was neither
            inevitable nor universal. Rabbi Elimelekh of Lyzhansk passed away in 1787,
            and it was his students such as the Seer of Lublin, the Maggid of
            Kozienice, and Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel of Apta who were seen as
            his primary successors.<span className="SuperScript">15</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;In Eretz Israel, after the death of Rabbi Menahem
            Mendel of Vitebsk in 1788, Rabbi Abraham Kalisker was widely if not uni-
            versally acknowledged as the former’s legitimate successor and the leader
            of the Hasidic Yishuv in the Holy Land. In the Ukraine, R. Levi Yitzhak of
            Berdichev passed away in 1810, and despite his enormous reputation and
            influence, he never established a dynasty; his sons were rabbis and schol-
            ars, but they never became “Berdichever Rebbes.”<span className="SuperScript">16</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Bratslav Hasidim
            rejected the dynastic principle entirely by regarding the death of Rabbi
            Nahman in 1810 as in some sense not real; the founder continued to lead
            them as an ongoing living presence.<span className="SuperScript">17</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;In White Russia, after the death of
            Rabbi Shneur Zalman in 1813, a struggle for succession developed between
            one of the rabbi’s sons and a gifted disciple, with the result hardly a fore-
            gone conclusion.<span className="SuperScript">18</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;In Polish Hasidism, the hereditary principle never tri-
            umphed completely, as time and again a charismatic senior disciple
            attracted the younger Hasidim of an aging or deceased master. As late as
            the mid-nineteenth century, the Halakhic authority and tsaddik Rabbi
            Hayyim Halberstam could write that the office of Hasidic rebbe should
            not be inherited, since “I do not know how the ability to pray can be
            inherited.”<span className="SuperScript">19</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>
            </div>
            <div className="PDFBody">

            Stephen Sharot has studied the Hasidic dynasties from a sociological
            perspective, drawing upon Max Weber’s work on the routinization of
            charisma.<span className="SuperScript">20</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;While Sharot acknowledges that “[n]o detailed theology was
            developed to justify the dynastic principle,” he makes reference to a
            Hasidic belief that “the holy thoughts of the tsaddik at the time of concep-
            tion would bring down an exceptional soul from heaven and that a child
            conceived and brought up in holiness would himself be holy.”<span className="SuperScript">21</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;He further
            notes that “it was considered important for not only the tsaddik but also
            his wife to be of pure lineage. First-cousin marriages strengthened the
            ‘holy seed’ of the next tsaddik.”<span className="SuperScript">22</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>
            </div>
            <div className="PDFBody">

            In a similar vein, Louis Jacobs has written that “particularly from the
            period of the Seer of Lublin, the idea of dynastic succession took hold, in
            the belief that the tsaddik’s holy thoughts when he made love to his wife
            could succeed in drawing down a specially elevated soul into the child
            conceived, who was thereby ideally suited to take his father’s place when
            the father departed this life.”<span className="SuperScript">23</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>
            </div>
            <div className="PDFBody">

            The term “holy seed”—zera kodesh—occurs frequently in Hasidic dis-
            cussions of tsaddikim and their families. It appears originally in the Bible
            (Ezra 9:2; cf. Neh. 9:2), in the context of the post-exilic program of forbid-
            ding intermarriage and banishing foreign wives, so that the “holy seed”
            would no longer “mingle with the people of the land.”<span className="SuperScript">24</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;When applied to
            Hasidic tsaddikim, it clearly suggests a theology of genealogical sanctity,
            involving the wife and her yihus (distinguished ancestry) no less than the
            husband.

            Yet most studies of Hasidism until now have largely overlooked the
            significance of women even in matters of genealogy. To take one striking
            example, the Encyclopaedia Judaica has an excellent chart of the relation-
            ships of the leading Hasidic dynasties, from the Baal Shem Tov to the pre-
            sent times, containing hundreds of names. With the exception of the Baal
            Shem Tov’s daughter, women are completely absent. The key to the chart
            lists the following relationships: father, son, grandson, son-in-law, teacher-
            disciple; but not mother, wife, daughter, or sister-in-law. This near-com-
            plete omission confirms an unfortunate pattern to which feminist
            historians have called attention and which they have attempted to redress.
            As Joan Wallach Scott has written, “Recent research has shown that women
            were not inactive or absent from events that made history, but that they
            have been systematically left out of the official record.”<span className="SuperScript">25</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall argue here
            that the role of the wives and mothers of tsaddikim was pivotal in the emer-
            gence of several key Hasidic dynasties and that the presence of women,
            when brought to the foreground, will reveal much about Hasidism in its
            economic, social, genealogical, and spiritual dimensions. The retrieval of
            this suppressed presence will be the subject of the rest of this essay.<span className="SuperScript">26</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Crisis of the Interregnum, 1802: Chava, the Mother of

            Around the year 1800 the distinctive identities of the various Hasidic
            courts began to emerge into full view.<span className="SuperScript">27</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1796, for example, Rabbi Shneur
            Zalman of Liady published his famous work known popularly as Tanya,
            which did so much to forge the special character of Habad Hasidism. In
            1802 Rabbi Nathan of Nemirov, a devotee of Hasidism who had previously
            visited many tsaddikim, became a faithful disciple of Rabbi Nahman of
            Bratslav, apprenticing himself to this one master exclusively. As the fore-
            most follower and amanuensis of Rabbi Nahman, Rabbi Nathan had a
            central role in the crystallization of Bratslav Hasidism.<span className="SuperScript">28</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;And in 1798, after
            the death of Rabbi Menahem Nahum of Chernobyl, his son Rabbi Morde-
            cai succeeded him; this has been called the first appearance of the dynastic
            principle in Hasidism.<span className="SuperScript">29</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was due in large measure to Rabbi Mordecai
            that the House of Chernobyl became the exemplar of what is meant by a
            Hasidic dynasty. He was among the first tsaddikim to establish an aristo-
            cratic court on the grand style; each of his eight sons became a rebbe in
            his own right, establishing courts in various Ukrainian towns and thereby
            propelling the geographic diffusion of Chernobyl Hasidism and the move-
            ment as a whole.<span className="SuperScript">30</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>

            David Assaf, in his recent biography of the celebrated tsaddik Rabbi
            Israel of Ruzhin (1796–1850), states that “little is known about Chava,”
            Israel’s mother.<span className="SuperScript">31</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;And indeed, in the over five hundred pages of his meticu-
            lously documented and insightfully written study of Rabbi Israel, Chava
            receives only passing mention. In this, Assaf mirrors the more traditional
            works of Hasidic hagiography, which, when they speak of Chava or most
            other women, nearly always do so to highlight and frame the virtues of the
            male tsaddik. Yet Chava lived to about seventy-five, an unusually long lifes-
            pan in those days; she outlived Rabbi Shalom Shakhna, her husband and
            Rabbi Israel’s father, by forty-two years. (Rabbi Shalom Shakhna was the
            grandson of the Rabbi Dov Ber, the Maggid of Mezhirech, the most famous
            figure in Hasidism after the Baal Shem Tov and widely considered the actual
            founder of Hasidism as an organized movement.) She accompanied her son
            through every stage of his controversial and stormy career and died in Sad-
            gora only six years before he did. It is hard to believe that she was not a sig-
            nificant influence on her famous son, despite the near silence of the sources.
            In such a circumstance it seems appropriate to carefully examine and
            reassess the materials we have, bringing neglected information to the fore-
            ground and looking for patterns which eluded or were not of interest to
            earlier writers. What emerges not only will tell us much about women in
            Hasidism, but will shed new light on the Hasidic movement as a whole.<span className="SuperScript">32</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;One unusual phenomenon which appeared early in the Hasidic move-
            ment was the yenuka, the “wonder-child” who assumes a leadership role at
            a very young age. As Assaf notes, perhaps the very first yenuka in Hasidism
            was Abraham (1787–1813), Chava’s eldest son. When Abraham’s father
            Rabbi Shalom Shakhna died in 1802, the fifteen-year-old Abraham took
            over the leadership of his father’s Hasidim. Rabbi Shalom Shakhna died
            just before Sukkot that year, and as the Hasidim tell the story, “on the first
            night of Sukkot [just hours after his father’s funeral and burial] Rabbi
            Abraham entered the sukkah, sat on his father’s seat, and began to assume
            the reins of leadership, in the grand manner, as his father’s successor.”<span className="SuperScript">33</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;The assumption of communal leadership by a fifteen-year-old boy was
            noted with derision by the maskilim. Joseph Perl mentions Abraham by
            name in his anti-Hasidic polemic, Uiber das Wesen der Sekte Chassidim (On
            the Nature of the Sect of the Hasidim), completed in 1816.<span className="SuperScript">34</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;And from that
            time on, the phenomenon of the yenuka became a frequent target of maskilic
            scorn and satire. We will have more to say about a later instance of this below.
            Abraham’s behavior is never fully explained in the Hasidic sources.
            Many of the faithful probably saw it as just one more example of the
            preternatural powers of the tsaddik, often expressed in patterns of action
            which cannot be comprehended by lesser mortals. The more learned
            undoubtedly recalled passages in the Zohar where a yenuka makes an
            appearance, bringing particularly sublime and recondite wisdom.<span className="SuperScript">35</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;For his
            part, Assaf sees Abraham’s action as “cynical behavior,” a power-grab by a
            youngster who, in his “urgent need for legitimization,” rushed to gain the
            assent of his family to his succession.<span className="SuperScript">36</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;But how plausible is it that a
            youngster, barely fifteen years old (as Joseph Perl already pointed out in
            1816), is so filled with the urge for power and the attendant burdens and
            responsibilities of communal leadership, that he grabs the reins just a few
            hours after his dead father has been interred? It is certainly reasonable to
            ask whether an adult may have been involved in the decision.

            The main account of young Abraham’s succession appears in a hagio-
            graphic collection of Ruzhin traditions known as Bet Yisrael (House of
            Israel), originally published in 1913 by Reuben Zak.<span className="SuperScript">37</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;The stories about
            Rabbi Abraham do not hide the astonishment felt by many, even among
            the Hasidim, that such a youngster had assumed the reins of his father’s
            community.

            It is interesting that nearly all the accounts of this episode make specific
            mention of Abraham’s mother. One such tradition states that
            on that night of Sukkot [Abraham] took his younger brother, the future
            Ruzhiner Rebbe [who was six years old at the time], and wanted to enter the
            sukkah. He said, “We must first go to our mother the zaddeket and say Gut
            Yom Tov (essentially, Happy Holiday) to her.” He told her, “God now has a
            new guest in heaven; we ought to send Him something in honor of the
            guest. What should I send? I will say Kiddush in his honor.” So he entered
            the sukkah and made Kiddush.<span className="SuperScript">38</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>

            Chava’s response is not recorded, but her silence suggests agreement. And
            the line “‘We must first go to our mother the zaddeket (a saintly individ-
            ual) . . .’” may be a way of hinting at the obvious: that no family decision—
            especially at such a time, and of such consequence—could have been
            made without the mother, and that Chava may have been actively involved
            from the very beginning. In any event, it is clear that Abraham was con-
            cerned to receive his mother’s consent, post facto if not ab initio.
            Consider the following: Chava was a granddaughter of Rabbi Menahem
            Nahum of Chernobyl (1730–1797), a foundational personality from
            Hasidism’s early period, a disciple of the Baal Shem Tov and the Maggid of
            Mezhirech, and the author of the seminal work Me’or Eynayim (The Light
            of the Eyes).<span className="SuperScript">39</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Chava’s uncle was Rabbi Menahem Nahum’s son and suc-
            cessor, Rabbi Mordecai of Chernobyl (1770–1837). As noted above, he was
            one of the first tsaddikim to live on a grand scale, in the manner of Russ-
            ian nobility.<span className="SuperScript">40</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>

            Rabbi Shalom Shakhna enjoyed a successful tenure as rebbe in Proho-

            and respected personality throughout Ukrainian Hasidism.<span className="SuperScript">41</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;He must
            have had a sizable following. In light of this, it should come as no surprise
            that he had already begun living in a princely manner, much unlike his
            ascetic father, Rabbi Abraham “the Angel.” This mirrors the generational
            trajectory that his wife Chava had experienced in Chernobyl. Her grandfa-
            ther Rabbi Menahem Nahum had lived a life of extreme self-denial and
            poverty, while his son Rabbi Mordecai—Chava’s uncle—had introduced
            the aristocratic style of leadership.

            At the time of Rabbi Shalom Shakhna’s passing in 1802, Chava was
            confronted with the dissipation of his community and the collapse of
            her position within it. We recall that at this time dynastic rights were
            not universally asserted or recognized, and the very notion of an “heir”
            to the seat of a tsaddik had not fully crystallized. In general the corpo-
            rate identity of a Hasidic community did not long survive without
            direct personal contact with a living master.<span className="SuperScript">42</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the announce-
            ment of a successor, the Hasidim of Prohobitch would have naturally
            dispersed, each looking for a new tsaddik in some other location. But if
            the Hasidic community of Prohobitch were not to survive with its iden-
            tity intact, Chava would have been just another widow with most
            uncertain prospects. And without dynastic succession, her two sons
            would have been not heirs, but mere orphans in a society which had no
            dearth of fatherless children.

            The force of these concerns is brought into greater relief when seen in
            light of an earlier episode in the family’s history. Rabbi Abraham the
            Angel—Rabbi Shalom Shakhna’s father, son of the Maggid of
            Mezhirech—had himself died young, in the fall of 1776. His widow, Gitl,
            left her two young children and went to Eretz Israel, spending the rest of
            her life there in obscurity. The two orphans were taken in by the tsaddik
            Rabbi Shlomo of Karlin, who educated them and found appropriate
            matches when the time came (the older brother married Rabbi Shlomo’s
            own daughter, while Shalom Shakhna was betrothed to the granddaughter
            of Rabbi Menahem Nahum of Chernobyl—our Chava). Gitl’s departure
            was never explained, and the whole episode is shrouded in obscurity. But
            the abandonment of the eight-year old Shalom Shakhna by his mother,
            just after the death of his father, must have profoundly shaken him and
            left its mark on the entire family. Now, one generation later, Rabbi Shalom
            Shakhna had himself died, leaving two young children. It must have
            seemed an eerie echo of the past, with history in danger of repeating itself.
            The fifteen-year-old Abraham would have had strong motivation to step
            in and try to fill his father’s shoes, for his own sake as well as for his
            mother’s. Nothing would have been more important than the stability of
            the family, which required the continuity of the community his father had
            built up.
            <br/><br/>
            </div>
            <div className="PDFBody">

            Abraham and his mother, Chava, had a convergence of interests. The
            fifteen-year-old still needed his mother, for himself and his six-year-old
            brother, Israel. And if he was to succeed as a rebbe, he surely needed the
            guidance and experience his mother could provide. Chava would have
            known the Hasidim as individuals—not just their personal idiosyncrasies
            and aspirations, but the role each Hasid played in the constellation of her
            late husband’s community. This detailed information would have been
            indispensable for an inexperienced youngster trying to lead a group of
            followers out of a crisis of continuity. For her part, Chava needed her
            son Abraham, for, being a woman, she could not officially lead the
            Hasidim. As a Twersky of Chernobyl, she had had first-hand knowledge
            of the emerging aristocratic leadership style. But whatever her depth of
            experience and knowledge, only her son Abraham could be the tsaddik.
            Only he could avert the dissolution of the community her husband had
            built. In light of this convergence of interests, it is only reasonable to
            assume that Chava would have assisted her son in his consolidation of
            leadership, and she may have pointed the way from the very beginning.
            This supposition receives support from the repeated references to Chava’s
            motherly guidance of Abraham and Israel. (Abraham died in 1811, at
            which point Israel assumed leadership of the community. Strikingly,
            Israel was then fifteen years old—the same age his older brother Abra-
            ham was in 1802, when he first sat in his father’s seat!) Hasidic tradition
            preserves memories reflecting Chava’s deep concern for her children’s
            development, even from before birth. There is a notable remark from the
            Apter Rav, Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, considered Hasidism’s most
            senior and revered figure in the last decade of his life (1815–1825).<span className="SuperScript">43</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;When
            Chava was pregnant with her younger son, Israel, the future Ruzhiner
            Rebbe, the Apter is quoted as calling Chava “the Holy Ark” who was car-
            rying (in her womb) a Torah scroll.<span className="SuperScript">44</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be a mistake to dismiss
            this as nothing but typical Hasidic exaggeration, a pious encomium for a
            future leader. The phrase “Holy Ark” (Aron ha-Kodesh) resonates with
            Kabbalistic meaning, alluding to the Sefirah of Malkhut, or “sovereignty,”
            and associated with the receptive feminine aspect of the divine realm,
            also known as Shekhinah.<span className="SuperScript">45</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;To anyone with even a modest familiarity
            with Kabbalistic symbolism, this would have suggested that the union of
            Chava with her husband, Rabbi Shalom Shakhna, was a sacred rite des-
            tined to produce extraordinary offspring. A related tradition states that
            during the entire nine months of her pregnancy with Israel, Chava was
            secluded in her private chamber. No one came into her room other than
            her maids and ladies-in-waiting, thus protecting the pure and holy soul
            of the future Ruzhiner Rebbe from wayward glances and influences.<span className="SuperScript">46</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;These traditions reflect an intense level of agency on Chava’s part in the
            spiritual development of her offspring.

            Chava’s active involvement in the upbringing of her children continued
            during their childhood and apparently intensified after the death of her
            husband. The sources tell of visits to the great tsaddikim of the day to
            receive their blessing, including the Seer of Lublin<span className="SuperScript">47</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;and the Apter Rav.
            Around 1805 (three years after her husband’s death) Chava brought the
            two brothers to Berdichev, home of Rabbi Levi Yitzhak. Rabbi Shneur Zal-
            man of Lyady, the founder of Habad Hasidism, who was visiting in
            Berdichev at the time, is said to have been greatly impressed with Israel’s
            profound religious insight.<span className="SuperScript">48</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture which emerges from these stories
            is that of a mother engaged in the project of introducing her sons to the
            foremost Hasidic leaders of the era. As a devotee of Hasidism, she was
            undoubtedly following the pious practice of securing blessings from holy
            masters; but it also seems evident that she was intent on grooming her
            sons, orphaned from their father, in the ways of the tsaddikim. In addi-
            tion, these courtesy calls built support among influential leaders to legiti-
            mate her sons’ succession.

            At times Chava appears as an unspoken but clear presence in her sons’
            life. An example of this is Israel of Ruzhin’s Tosefet Ketubah—a codicil of
            supplementary provisions to the ketubah, the traditional marriage con-
            tract. In this fascinating document, recently published for the first time,<span className="SuperScript">49</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;the boilerplate ketubah obligation has been augmented by the sum of 1,548
            rubles. This substantial commitment indicates that the family already had
            considerable financial resources. And the date (9 Elul 5569) reveals that
            Israel was wed in 1809, at age twelve—before his Bar Mitzvah!<span className="SuperScript">50</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that
            he had no father, it is impossible to suppose that his mother was not
            involved in the arrangements and negotiations. Significantly, young Israel
            is repeatedly referred to as ha-yanik—a variant form of the word yenuka
            we have already encountered, but here in a legal document. The word
            bespeaks his youth and precocity. But it also conveys a hint of its etymo-
            logical origin, from yanak—to suckle, nurse, breast-feed—hence pointing
            to a mother hovering in the background, providing nurturance and guid-
            ance, even if not acknowledged.

            We have a report from the early years of Israel’s marriage that Israel
            refused to perform his marital duty. He gave pious reasons for his behav-
            ior, but it must also be remembered that he was scarcely a teenager at this
            time. In any event, Chava sought the intervention of Rabbi Abraham
            Joshua Heschel of Apta, who was able to assure Israel that “engagement in
            the commandment to be fruitful and multiply” was entirely proper and
            that he would be blessed with children worthy of his sacred lineage.<span className="SuperScript">51</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel of Apta was also the source for an
            extraordinary and widely circulated claim made about the Ruzhiner: that
            he never forgot what the angel had taught him in his mother’s womb.<span className="SuperScript">52</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;This relates to the old rabbinic aggadah (legend) that for the nine
            months of gestation, babies in the womb are taught Torah by an angel,
            only to be tapped on the mouth at birth, forgetting everything.<span className="SuperScript">53</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;A
            prominent follower of the Ruzhiner, Rabbi Reuven Horenstien of Odessa,
            was astonished at the thought that his master had retained his prenatal
            memories, and once ventured to ask the rebbe, “‘How can such a thing
            be?’” The Ruzhiner replied, “‘Go ask my mother.’” Rebbetzin Chava
            answered as follows:
            <br/><br/>
            </div>
            <div className="PDFBody">

            “There is indeed a rabbinic teaching that an angel studies the entire Torah
            with the baby before he is born into this world. Just as he is about to leave
            his mother’s womb, an angel comes, slaps him on the mouth, and he forgets
            everything. But these very different tasks—that of teaching, and that of
            expunging memories—are not performed by the same angel, rather by two
            different angels. What then, gives rise to the Angel of Forgetting? It is the
            final thought of intercourse [the self-awareness of orgasm]. Believe me that
            neither I nor my late husband, Rabbi Shalom of Prohobitch, had such a
            thought at that time, so no Angel of Forgetting was created. That is why my
            son remembers everything.”<span className="SuperScript">54</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>
            </div>
            <div className="PDFBody">

            In this extraordinary exchange, Chava is asserting the unique spiritual
            power of her son; more, she is asserting her co-responsibility—along
            with her late husband—for engendering that power in an act of concep-
            tion without sexual lust. By avoiding the indulgence of orgasmic forget-
            ting, Chava and Rabbi Shalom Shakhna were in control of their sexual
            natures. Having maintained their spiritual awareness at a moment when
            most couples surrender to passion, they birthed a child continually in
            contact with God and His pristine Torah. Furthermore, by referring the
            questioner to his mother, the Ruzhiner was effectively endorsing her
            reply: his birth was the result of a sacred union, and his charismatic
            powers derived from his mother as much as his late father. And the nar-
            rative frame of the story—in which a prominent follower turns to the
            great tsaddik’s mother for a decades-old truth that only she could
            know—inscribes Chava’s role as matriarch of the family, as the reposi-
            tory of sacred knowledge and history, and as the wise guardian of origins
            and bedrock of dynastic identity.

            Finally, there is an astonishing family tradition that the Ruzhiner attrib-
            uted his imprisonment in Kiev to his mother, Chava. During the period of
            incarceration (1838–1840) Chava longed to hear some word from her son.
            A certain Hasid managed to gain entry to the Ruzhiner’s cell and was able
            to converse with him. As the visit ended, the Hasid asked the tsaddik for a
            sign, a signal by which he could prove to Chava that he had actually met
            with her son. Rabbi Israel responded, “‘Tell my mother that she is respon-
            sible for my entire incarceration.’” When the Hasid reported on his visit to
            Chava and told her what her son had said, she replied:
            <br/><br/>
            </div>
            <div className="PDFBody">

            “That’s exactly right—It’s my fault that my son is in prison. Let me tell you
            the story. Before he gave birth in holiness to his youngest son [Mordecai
            Shraga of Husyatin], he came to me and said that he has the opportunity to
            bring down a very great and lofty soul, such as the world has not seen in the
            last two thousand years; but as a consequence he would be forced to suffer a
            painful exile. So he asked me for my advice, and I replied, ‘My son, what
            don’t we do for our children’s sake?’”<span className="SuperScript">55</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>
            </div>
            <div className="PDFBody">

            This story once again links the Ruzhiner’s mother, Chava, with motifs of
            holy sexual union and the birth of sacred souls. Here she is depicted as the
            matriarch of the family, steering it toward a glorious spiritual destiny at
            whatever cost to her son’s physical or material welfare. Whatever we make
            of the theology implicit in this story, it places Chava in the role of behind-
            the-scenes guide to her son on a matter of utmost gravity, of vital concern
            to the lineage and her family’s future.

            When taken in the aggregate, the sheer number of vignettes and remi-
            niscences which feature Chava is impressive. I cannot think of another
            early tsaddik who is linked so strongly and consistently in the hagio-
            graphic literature with his mother.<span className="SuperScript">56</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;And these traditions always spotlight
            Chava’s concern for family continuity, a concern whose spiritual and
            material components are inseparable. Willy-nilly, these memories testify to
            Chava’s ongoing leadership in the Ruzhin dynasty.

            So far as I know, we have no correspondence from Chava, but one item
            which did survive is Chava’s ring, extant to this day.<span className="SuperScript">57</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;On one side are
            engraved the words “To light the Sabbath lamp,” and on the other, “Chava
            daughter of our master Rabbi Abraham, may God preserve and redeem
            him.” Such a ring, crafted at a time when her father was still living,
            bespeaks a confident self-awareness of aristocratic position.<span className="SuperScript">58</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;In all, we
            catch sight of an influential woman, utilizing her stature to advance the
            situation of her sons while securing her place at the very core of
            Hasidism’s new aristocracy. While any analysis of her motives must
            include the factors of economic self-interest and social position, for Chava
            these considerations would have been totally intermingled with thoughts
            of her venerable ancestors, on the one hand, and her belief in her sons as
            tsaddikim, on the other. Chava surely believed that the great legacy of the
            Maggid of Mezhirech, Rabbi Abraham the Angel, her husband, Rabbi
            Shalom Shakhna, and her grandfather Rabbi Menahem Nahum of Cher-
            nobyl could best be preserved and transmitted by the sacred souls which
            she had brought into the world.

            Let us now return to that first night of Sukkot in 1802, mere hours after
            the death of Rabbi Shalom Shakhna. We will never know in full what
            motivated the newly orphaned boy to move (quite literally) into his
            father’s seat, to the chagrin and astonishment of the Hasidim. But it was
            surely the case that Abraham sought and received his mother’s consent,
            post facto if not ab initio. Rising to the role of filial successor—a role still
            rare and unexpected in Hasidism—Abraham, with his mother’s support,
            saved the cohesive community built by his father from immediate dissipa-
            tion. Crystallized around family loyalty and the memory of great prede-
            cessors, the community’s identity remained intact, much as had already
            happened in Chava’s own family where the Hasidic community of Cher-
            nobyl had become a proprietary domain. With his mother as his silent
            partner, the son laid the foundation for what would soon flower into the
            great lineage of Mezhirech-Prohobitch-Ruzhin. Abraham of Prohobitch
            and his younger brother, Israel (later of Ruzhin), were no longer orphans
            but heirs, dauphins of an emergent dynasty which would influence
            Hasidism for all time to come.

            On the twelfth of Tammuz (midsummer) 1844, Chava passed away. She

            In 1875, an article appeared in Peretz Smolenskin’s Ha-Shahar (The
            Dawn), published in Vienna, titled “Hitgalut ha-Yenuka mi-Stolin,” or
            “The Debut of the Yenuka of Stolin.” Israel Davidson, in Parody in Jewish
            Literature, writes that the “Hitgalut” is a “satire directed against the abuses
            of the Tsaddikim of the House of Karlin in general, but in particular
            against the accession of the five year old son of Rabbi Asher of Karlin into

            Karlin (1736–1772). His incumbency as leader of the Karlin-Stolin Hasidim
            lasted forty-five years. When he died in 1872, he was succeeded by his son
            Rabbi Asher the Second (1827–1873). But Rabbi Asher died only one year
            after his father, and Karlin-Stolin Hasidism was beset by a crisis of conti-
            nuity, having sustained in rapid succession the loss of two beloved leaders.
            The only male heir was Rabbi Asher’s son, Israel, who was about four and
            a half years old at the time of his father’s passing. When the child was
            about five years old, the Stolin elders announced that Israel had been des-
            ignated his father’s successor and would henceforth lead the Hasidic com-
            munity of Stolin.<span className="SuperScript">61</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>

            When this turn of events became known to the wider community, it
            provoked astonishment; almost immediately maskilim rushed to satirize
            what in their view was an absurd example of Hasidic credulousness. The
            best-known example is “Hitgalut ha-Yenuka mi-Stolin,” signed “Had min
            Havraya,” a pseudonym meaning “One of the Fellows.” One question
            which seems not to have been asked by either the maskilim or the subse-
            quent scholarly writers on this topic is, Why did the Stoliner Hasidim do
            it? That is, even granting their putative naivete, there must have been a
            compelling reason which led them to the extraordinary step of appointing
            a five-year-old as their leader. They must surely have anticipated that such
            a decision would attract ridicule and contempt.

            To answer this question, we must take a closer look at the article pub-
            lished in Ha-shahar, which Davidson attributed to Yehuda Leib Levin.<span className="SuperScript">62</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;This attribution is only partially correct. The “Hitgalut” actually has a
            composite character, with two distinct sections. The article begins and
            concludes with a “Letter to the Editor,” which introduces and frames the
            core document, a letter from “the Rabbi of Turov, a town near Pinsk.” The
            tone of the two sections differs dramatically. The frame letter is a typical
            maskilic satire, by turns ludicrously pompous, bathetic, and ribald, with
            repeated references to the rumored sexual inadequacy of the tsaddikim. By
            contrast, the core letter is entirely serious. It does herald the advent of the
            yenuka, and portrays him as gifted with an extraordinary intellect, musical
            ability, and supernatural powers; it also claims for him a messianic soul.
            But with all this, the tone is quite different from the carnivalesque style of
            the frame letter, which is typical of anti-Hasidic parodies such Joseph
            Perl’s Megaleh Temirin.<span className="SuperScript">63</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;The core letter is characterized by an earnest and
            plaintive note of urgency which accurately reflects the Karlin-Stolin crisis
            of succession and the concern of the elders to hold the group together
            around the child as titular leader.

            “The Rabbi of Turov” is a historical figure: his name is Ya’akov Noson
            Weisman (c. 1832–1916), who indeed served as rabbi of Turov (a small
            town east of Pinsk) and later emigrated to Eretz Israel where he was a
            rabbi in Tiberias; he died in Safed in 1916.<span className="SuperScript">64</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yehuda Leib Levin was shown
            a copy of Weisman’s letter and grasped the opportunity to augment it into
            a full-scale assault on Karlin-Stolin Hasidism. He wrote the frame letter
            which enabled him to incorporate other scandalous and embarrassing
            material. He also festooned Weisman’s original letter with mock-serious
            footnotes, which added to the fun but further obscured the composite
            character of the whole. The original, authentic letter without Levin’s
            embellishments (but with a side-by-side Yiddish translation) appears in a
            Yiddish-language journal published in Lemberg, Jsrulik (The Israelite), in
            the issue of October 30, 1875.<span className="SuperScript">65</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Levin tells the entire story in the year 1900,
            in Hatchiah (The Renaissance), a Hebrew literary weekly published in
            Chicago.<span className="SuperScript">66</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>

            For all their differences, Weisman’s original letter, Levin’s 1875 parody,
            and Levin’s 1900 article agree on one thing: young Israel Perlow’s mother
            had a hand in her son’s accession to the leadership of Karlin-Stolin. Levin
            (1900) writes that the idea to give the Karlin-Stolin dynastic seat to the
            child came from the mother’s circle of supporters (mekoraveha); the Rabbi
            of Turov, who was acting as gabbai (administrative assistant) for the
            mother, wrote and circulated his letter to gather support for the child’s
            accession.

            </div>
            <div className="PDFBody">

            Levin’s 1875 satire states that in contrast to tsaddikim who are accused
            of living in extravagant style, “this lad drinks only a little wine in order to
            get accustomed to sacred service; he eats little and dresses modestly. He
            takes no pleasure in all the money he receives from thousands of hasidim,
            for he gives it all to his mother.”<span className="SuperScript">67</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>
            </div>
            <div className="PDFBody">

            But undoubtedly the most reliable source is Rabbi Weisman’s original
            letter. Weisman mentions steps that were already taken to place the child
            in charge of Karlin-Stolin institutions in both Russia and the Holy Land.
            He continues, “His mother the Rebbetzin has the authority to appoint
            overseers for governance of the sacred institutions, as well as tax collectors
            (anshei ma’amad) of her choice. [This arrangement will hold] until the
            righteous Shoot will grow to adulthood. . . . And everyone knows about
            the matter of Jehoash of blessed memory.”<span className="SuperScript">68</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>
            </div>
            <div className="PDFBody">

            The rather cryptic reference to Jehoash requires some elucidation. In 2
            Kings 11–12 (cf. 2 Chronicles 22–24) Jehoash, son of Ahaziah, is the only
            survivor of a bloody purge which attempted to eliminate every legitimate
            contender for the Davidic throne. He is secreted away as an infant by his
            aunt Jehoshiba and kept hidden for six years. In his seventh year,
            Jehoshiba’s husband, the high priest Jehoiada, reveals the young lad to the
            people, and Jehoash is anointed and crowned as king in a ceremony cele-
            brating the renewal of the Davidic dynasty. The salient parallels are clear:
            Davidic descent and messianic claims were advanced for young Israel Per-
            low, he was a “child-king,” and his cause was being championed by a close
            woman relative: for Jehoash, his aunt; in the case of Israel Perlow, his
            mother. The naming of Jehoash at the very end of Weisman’s letter is
            intended to invoke a powerful biblical precedent for the installation of a
            child-leader, but it also points to the central role that young Israel’s
            mother had in directing the course of events.

            Who was Israel Perlow’s mother? Born in 1844, her name was Sarah
            Devorah Shapiro; she was a great-great granddaughter to Rabbi Israel
            the Maggid of Kozienice (1737–1814), one of the founders of Hasidism
            in Poland. Her first marriage, to a second cousin who was heir to the
            Kozienice Hasidic dynasty, ended with her husband’s death in 1866.
            The young widow soon remarried (1867), this time to Rabbi Asher
            Perlow of Stolin (1827–1873), whose role as tsaddik of the Karlin-Stolin
            line has already been mentioned.<span className="SuperScript">69</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;When Sarah Devorah left Congress
            Poland for White Russia to marry Rabbi Asher, she brought along her
            two children from her first husband, a boy and a girl. In Stolin, Sarah
            Devorah presented her husband, Rabbi Asher, with three children, two
            girls and a boy. The boy, born in 1868, was named Israel. When his
            father died in 1873, it was he who was brought forward as successor;
            he is our yenuka.

            Let us consider Sarah Devorah’s situation at the time of Rabbi Asher’s
            death in 1873. She was twenty-nine years old. Within a span of just seven
            years, she had lost two husbands (she had lived about six years with each
            one). This was enough to stigmatize her and make it most unlikely that
            she would ever marry again. But she was the mother of five children,
            and—of special importance in Hasidic society—she had given birth to
            two boys, each of whom was heir to a well-known lineage: Kozienice in
            Poland, then Karlin-Stolin in White Russia. Sarah Devorah would have
            had an intense personal interest in the deliberations regarding the choice
            of a successor to her late husband, Rabbi Asher Perlow, and her efforts to
            see her son installed are fully understandable.<span className="SuperScript">70</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>
            </div>
            <div className="PDFBody">

            Sarah Devorah figures prominently in a memoir<span className="SuperScript">71</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;written by her grand-
            daughter and published in Israel in 1967. The granddaughter, whose name
            was Malkah Shapiro, writes of her youth in Kozienice, Poland. The memoir
            is set in 1905, after Sarah Devorah has returned from White Russia to her
            native Poland, together with her son from her first marriage, Yerahmiel
            Moshe Hapstein, who assumed the incumbent seat as Rebbe of Kozienice.
            In Shapiro’s memoir, Sarah Devorah manages the affairs of the court
            and makes all major decisions. She is appropriately respectful to her son,
            who is after all the Rebbe, but Yerahmiel Moshe treats his mother with the
            greatest reverence. She is constantly chastising him for endangering his
            health with a grueling schedule of study and service, and with extreme
            asceticism. A major point of contention is the question of building a new
            mansion to replace the elegant home which was destroyed in a fire about
            six years earlier. Sarah Devorah, along with a group of loyal and generous
            Hasidim, conspires to go ahead with plans for new construction, but Yer-
            ahmiel Moshe does his best to subvert their intentions. Eventually the new
            house does begin to rise, due to Sarah Devorah’s indefatigable marshalling
            of architectural, financial, and managerial resources. Speaking Polish, she
            works with contractors, artisans, and suppliers of raw materials, conducts
            labor negotiations, and deals with work stoppages and strikes. Everyone is
            frightened of her: she need only give one look in the direction of a group
            of chatting workers, and they fall silent and return to work. In addition to
            managing the household and court in Kozienice, she owns a country
            estate where the family would often spend summers. Shapiro remembers
            her grandmother Sarah Devorah as a woman of elegance, culture, and
            refinement, who prizes education and piety. Her knowledge of German
            and of delicate embroidery techniques was obtained from a tutor whom
            she herself had imported from Hungary. She maintains excellent relation-
            ships with members of the Polish nobility; they respect her family heritage
            and cultural sophistication, and share her aristocratic values rooted in an
            era that was fast disappearing. But along with the ambience of majesty
            and nobility that Sarah Devorah cultivates, there is also devout piety and
            the fear of heaven. In between her managerial activities she prays and
            recites psalms. The Rebbetzin’s blessings are sought by Polish peasants as
            well as by Hasidim.

            As depicted in her granddaughter’s memoir, Sarah Devorah is a
            dynamic, enterprising, and courageous individual who confidently travels
            to the crown city of St. Petersburg for an interview at the Russian imperial
            palace. With a memory of events going back to the first half of the nine-
            teenth century, she is the repository and transmitter of the family’s sacred
            traditions and foundational stories. Shapiro depicts her sitting at the head
            of the table, surrounded by family members and Hasidim who listen in
            rapt attention as she tells mystic stories from her childhood. She is domi-
            neering and assertive, but these qualities are essential for her effectiveness
            in managing the household and court.

            Sarah Devorah’s fears for her son’s health are entirely justified: Yerah-
            miel Moshe died in 1909. She lived through the Great War, and it was she
            who made the decision for the family to leave Kozienice for Warsaw when
            the town became a battlefield. Scion of the Maggid of Kozienice and
            widow of two major tsaddikim, it was she who nurtured and transmitted
            the household’s sense of itself as a royal dynasty. She died in Warsaw in
            1921 at age seventy seven, surviving both her sons.

            son Israel Perlow, the yenuka. In particular, Rabbi Weisman’s original let-

            her role as dynastic regent, the actual power behind her son, the “child-

            David Assaf has written about the enormous financial resources that
            were necessary to run the large Hasidic courts such as that of Ruzhin, and
            the techniques that arose to supply the requisite funds. But Assaf and his
            primary sources say almost nothing about actual administration: who
            made purchasing decisions and paid the bills; who hired, fired, and super-
            vised the large staff of servants, workers, kitchen help, artisans, and con-
            tractors; who oversaw the comings and goings of honored guests, Hasidic
            pilgrims, and the poor; who decided on renovations, additions, and major
            construction; who purchased real estate and invested assets, negotiated
            with local and regional authorities, tracked the distribution of charitable
            funds and the governance of religious institutions, and so on?<span className="SuperScript">72</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a
            major administrative role could only have been filled by a trusted intimate
            of the tsaddik, most likely a close family member.<span className="SuperScript">73</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Malkah Shapiro’s
            memoir makes it clear that at least in one instance it was the family matri-
            arch, Sara Devorah Shapiro, who filled that role.

            </div>
            <div className="PDFBody">

            Nor can such a role be dismissed as marginal to the tsaddik’s spiritual
            focus. The regal Hasidic court as it developed through the nineteenth cen-
            tury expressed an embodied social theology. The tsaddik’s role as sacred
            pivot of his community, as “axis mundi,”<span className="SuperScript">74</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;was concretized in the court
            itself, so that the structures of the court create a sacred domain analogous
            to the sacred space of the biblical Tabernacle and the Jerusalem Temples.<span className="SuperScript">75</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;The life of the court, in both its material and spiritual culture, displayed
            the theology of the tsaddik and nurtured the experience of the Hasid who
            came as pilgrim to see and to be seen.<span className="SuperScript">76</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>
            </div>
            <div className="PDFBody">

            The Hasidic court was not characterized by sharp delineations between
            the public and private, between domestic and communal. Hasidim, at least
            Hasidic intimates, came into the family residence all the time. Rebbetzins
            interacted with the entire community and could easily exercise control if
            they so desired. So it should not surprise us that in some cases it was a
            Rebbetzin such as Sarah Devorah Shapiro Perlow who guided the court’s
            administration. Such a Rebbetzin should be thought of as a regent direct-
            ing the spiritual and material fortunes of the lineage, bearing the dynasty’s
            vision of itself.<span className="SuperScript">77</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>

            When writing of the Stolin yenuka, Haskalah (Jewish Enlightenment)
            writers saw a story of venality, credulity, and superstition. They never
            bothered to think much about the mother of the wonder-child, other than
            to accuse her of appropriating the pidyon (redemption)-money. The “Hit-
            galut ha-Yenuka mi-Stolin” parody does not even refer to her by name.
            From the research presented here, however, a different picture emerges, a
            narrative of a woman of courage, intelligence, and energy, working to
            secure the continuity of her tradition and lineage. By struggling for her
            son’s position as dynastic heir, she was assuring her own continued role as
            queen mother, but she had every right to do so. Not the sovereign but the
            regent, Sara Devorah Shapiro Perlow, was destined to be forever the power
            behind the throne, the guardian of dynastic vision.

            Our analysis of Chava, mother of Rabbi Israel of Ruzhin, and Sarah Devo-
            rah Shapiro Perlow suggests the following: where there is a yenuka, there is
            likely a recently widowed mother, with very legitimate concerns about her
            lineage, promoting the role of her son and thereby securing her own posi-
            tion as well. After the crisis of the interregnum has passed and her son has
            successfully taken his place as tsaddik, a woman such as Chava or Sara
            Devorah would often settle into the role of dynastic elder, prized for first-
            hand knowledge of the events, traditions, and personalities of bygone
            days. If she also had the energy and ability, she might emerge as the de
            facto if unacknowledged leader of the Hasidic community, making key
            decisions and guiding its destiny as much as or even more than her son
            the tsaddik.

            Hasidic writers would have had no reason to publicize such an arrange-
            ment; wherever it existed, the Hasidim would have worked hard to shield
            it from view. And that is why the large corpus of hagiographic literature
            contains mere hints of the roles played by women such as Chava and Sara
            Devorah. This underscores the importance of reexamining that literature,
            as well as searching for documents and texts previously overlooked or
            undiscovered.

            At one point in Malkah Shapiro’s memoir, she mentions that Sarah

            received from tzakkikim, including appreciations of her son the wonder
            child.”<span className="SuperScript">78</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;The land documents and approbations of her son which this
            matriarch carried in her bosom were more than priceless possessions.
            They were the crown jewels of her Hasidic lineage, embodying its dynastic
            identity and hopes. There was no safer place for them than on the tablet of
            Sarah Devorah’s heart.

            10. In the event, Rabbi Dov Ber’s grandson, Rabbi Shalom Shakhna, success-
            fully established himself as a tsaddik; he and his descendents will play promi-
            nent roles in the discussion that follows. But while Rabbi Shalom Shakhna drew
            on the spiritual power and prestige of the Great Maggid, in no sense did he
            inherit an established Hasidic community, nor did he ever make the claim that
            he was the designated successor to his illustrious grandfather. His Rebistve (rab-
            binic office; tenured chair of a recognized tsaddik) in Prohobitch was his own
            making. Similar remarks pertain to Rabbi Barukh of Medzibozh, grandson of
            the Baal Shem Tov.

            11. Martin Buber begins his chapter on the Maggid of Mezhirech, in “Dov Ber
            of Mezritch, the Great Maggid” (Tales of the Hasidim: Early Masters [New York,
            1975]), with a story that depicts the five-year-old Dov Ber consoling his mother
            on the loss of her family tree, burned in a fire which destroyed their house. The
            tree traced the family’s lineage back to the great talmudic sage Rabbi Yohanan the
            sandal-maker. The young Dov Ber is quoted as saying, “‘And what does that mat-
            ter! I shall get you a new family tree which begins with me!’” (p. 98). But this
            story, which appeared first in 1930 and purports to describe an event from around
            1710, may be a retrospective projection of the later situation back to the time of
            the illustrious paterfamilias. The story actually supports the thesis developed
            herein: the dynastic vision emerges out of a child’s assuming responsibility for his
            mother in the wake of crisis.
            On the broader question of the reliability of hagiographic traditions, see
            below, nn. 37–38. It is obvious that as the time between the ostensible event and
            its first appearance in print increases, one’s confidence in its historicity dimin-
            ishes proportionally. Here, there is a gap of over two hundred years, much too
            long to give the story historical credence.

            Hasidic Zaddiq,” in Jewish Spirituality, edited by Arthur Green (New York, 1994),
            Vol. 2, pp. 127–156. Green observes that “The very notion of inherited dynasty, the
            right to authority in the Hasidic community by virtue of birth, smacked of royal-
            ism” (p. 144). For the earliest examples of leadership in the regal style, Green
            mentions Baruch of Medzibozh as well as Mordecai of Chernobyl. But Baruch is
            not the best example of the pattern under discussion because while he drew on
            the prestige of the Besht, he did not inherit an ongoing, established Hasidic com-
            munity; see above, n. 10. There was a gap of nearly thirty years between the
            Besht’s death and Baruch’s establishing his court in Medzibozh. And when
            Baruch died in 1810, his sons-in-law did not inherit his court (he had no sons).
            Shortly after Baruch’s death, Medzibozh became the seat of Abraham Joshua Hes-
            chel (formerly of Apta), until the latter’s death in 1825. On Mordecai of Cher-

            placed his hands on his disciples, bestowing aspects of his radiance upon them.
            He gave the Rabbi of Lublin the light of his eyes; to Rabbi Israel the Maggid of
            Kozienice he gave the power in his heart; to Rabbi Mendel of Pristik [later of
            Rymanov] he gave the soul in his mind; and to Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel of

            16. The apparent lack of interest on the part of Rabbi Levi Yitzhak in establish-
            ing a dynasty is conveyed in the following story, told by Rabbi Yitzhak of
            Neskhizh (d. 1868), son of the famed tsaddik Rabbi Mordecai of Neskhiz (d.
            1800). The story involves Rabbi Yitzhak himself and Rabbi Levi Yitzhak of
            Berdichev. “The Rabbi of Berdichev, in his last year of life (c. 1810) sent for Rabbi
            Yitzhak of Neskhizh to teach him the esoteric intentions of the mitzvah of Lulav
            and Etrog. The descendents of the Berdichever became jealous of the rabbi of
            Neskhizh, thinking, Why was the Berdichever teaching him and not them? The
            Berdichever answered them as follows: ‘When old Rabbi Mordecai of blessed
            memory [who had already died in 1800] will ask me in the World of Truth, What
            did you teach my son? I will need something to answer him, so that’s why I’m
            teaching him these esoteric intentions of Lulav and Etrog.’ Then the Berdichever
            closed the door to his descendents and transmitted to Rabbi Yitzhak those secret
            teachings.” The story, which appears in the collection Zikhron La-Rishonim
            (reprinted Brooklyn, 1976 [original, Piotrkow, 1910]), pp. 135–136, has the effect of
            promoting the standing of the teller, Rabbi Yitzhak. But it certainly captures accu-
            rately the reality that Rabbi Levi Yitzhak did not groom a successor from his own
            family.

            #32, quoted in Shaul Stampfer, “Inheritance of the Rabbinate in Eastern Europe in
            the Modern Period—Causes, Factors and Development over Time,” Jewish His-
            tory, Vol. 13, no. 1 (1999), p. 48. Stampfer argues that in the face of often bitter
            leadership struggles, the dynastic principle at least “limited the field of potential
            candidates and gave a justification for an heir’s claim” (“Inheritance of the Rab-

            ter 2, “‘The Main Thing Is One’s Own Distinction’: The Argument over Succes-
            sion,” pp. 47–65. Assaf adroitly traces the significance of hereditary succession in
            the Ruzhin dynasty, the claims of Davidic descent, the merit of the Maggid of
            Mezhirech, and the subdivisions of Ruzhin lineage in later generations. But there
            is little in the way of theological analysis.

            24. The holy seed rhetoric in Ezra has recently been studied by Christine A.
            Hayes in her Gentile Impurities and Jewish Identities: Intermarriage and Conver-
            sion from the Bible to the Talmud (New York, 2002). Hayes is very careful to point
            out that “Ezra does not say that Gentiles are genealogically impure (i.e., an
            impure seed, in contrast to Israel’s holy seed).” Rather, they are simply profane—
            that is, common, not distinguished by the gift of holiness, but not tainted or
            impure (pp. 30–32). The situation in Hasidism is rather similar if not identical: to
            this day, the families of tsaddikim have a strong preference for endogamous
            unions or, at a minimum, marriage to another aristocratic line, but there is no
            actual prohibition against a Hasidic scion marrying a Jewish commoner.

            26. Our discussion here will concentrate on aspects of the key dynasties of
            Ruzhin, Chernobyl, and Karlin-Stolin. Habad-Lubavitch will not be a major focus
            here but is a very important part of the topic as a whole; I hope to devote a sepa-
            rate study to dynastic emergence in Habad-Lubavitch. In an earlier article I dis-
            cussed the question of women as charismatic leaders in Hasidism; see Nehemia
            Polen, “Miriam’s Dance: Radical Egalitarianism in Hasidic Thought,” Modern
            Judaism, Vol. 12, No. 1 (1992), pp. 1–21. Here my focus is not on women as charis-
            matic leaders but as wives and mothers of tsaddikim, and their contributions to
            dynastic emergence and continuity.

            30. Arthur Green, Menahem Nahum of Chernobyl: Upright Practices, The Light
            of the Eyes (New York, 1982), notes that eventually this pattern of division and
            fragmentation was to lead to the impoverishment of the Hasidic courts (p. 21, n.
            22). See also Assaf, Regal Way, pp. 63–65; 307–309. But at the beginning of the
            nineteenth century there was ample opportunity in the form of new territory to
            be conquered for Hasidism. Thus, at this stage, the needs of family members to
            stake out their own territory dovetailed nicely with the expansionist agenda of the
            movement as a whole. The situation is reminiscent of the settling of New England
            in the roughly two centuries before 1800. The goal of every farmer was to clear
            enough land to set up each of his sons in an economically viable farm. Each suc-
            ceeding generation cleared and cultivated new areas farther away from earlier set-
            tlements. This process continued until they ran out of new territory, and there
            was no more available land to clear; see Diana Muir, Reflections in Bullough’s
            Pond: Economy and Ecosystem in New England (Hanover, 2000). Note, for exam-
            ple, her remark that “For several generations . . . Massachusetts was a land of
            plenty. [Colonial farmers] lived well, married young if they pleased, and reared
            large families in the full confidence that their children would enjoy a life as com-
            fortable as their own. . . . [E]arly-settled towns might not have had enough space
            for every young couple to settle on, but there was land enough elsewhere to allow
            the surplus young people of each generation to pioneer farms of their own” (pp.
            47–48). One can look at the spread of Hasidic territories during the nineteenth
            century in a similar way, as being largely driven by the ongoing branching of
            dynastic trees, as successive generations of sons and sons-in-law of famous tsad-
            dikim were motivated to find new towns in which to establish a rebistve.

            32. This approach draws upon feminist methods of historical-theological
            reconstruction, whose goal is not only the recovery of women’s voices as a
            domain of interest, but the reconstruction of a movement’s history in light of
            fresh awareness of women’s central role. See Elisabeth Schussler Fiorenza, In
            Memory of Her (New York, 1983); note esp. ch. 2, “Toward a Feminist Critical
            Method,” and ch. 3, “Toward a Feminist Model of Historical Reconstruction,” pp.
            41–95. See also Fiorenza’s Bread Not Stone: The Challenge of Feminist Biblical
            Interpretation (Boston, 1984), pp. 15–22. Following Paul Ricoeur, Fiorenza adopts a
            “hermeneutic of suspicion,” by which texts placing women in a marginal role may
            be interrogated to recover women’s central contributions. In my view such a
            “hermeneutic of suspicion,” however useful, must be accompanied and comple-
            mented by a hermeneutic of appreciation and gratitude. See below, note 37.

            34. Joseph Perl, Uiber das Wesen der Sekte Chassidim, edited by Avraham
            Rubinstein (Jerusalem, 1977), p. 94. Perl also mentions another yenuka, “Pinchsel
            Sohn des Rebi Srul Abraham.” The editor of Uiber das Wesen der Sekte Chassidim
            says that he was unable to identify this person, but Perl was evidently referring to
            Rabbi Pinhas Shapiro of Cherny Ostrov, a grandson of the famed Rabbi Zusia of
            Hannipol. Pinhas’s father, Rabbi Israel Abraham (1772–1814) was the publisher of
            No’am Elimelekh by his uncle Rabbi Elimelekh of Lyzhansk (Yitzhak Alfasi, Ha-
            Hasidut mi-Dor le-Dor (Jerusalem, 1995), Vol. 1, p. 149). Alfasi states that after
            Rabbi Israel Abraham’s death in 1814, “his widow conducted herself as a Rebbe,”
            and also offers the information that in 1834 she emigrated to the Holy Land and
            was killed in the earthquake of 1837 (ibid.). S. Z. Weinberg, Nezah she-be-Nezah
            (Jerusalem, 1994), records the tradition that her in-law Rabbi Mordecai of Cher-
            nobyl once attended her Se’udah Shelishit (third Sabbath meal, a sublime event)
            (p. 33). The phenomenon of a widow leading her late husband’s community,
            together with the appearance of a child-successor, is fully consistent with the the-
            sis of this essay. Rabbi Israel Abraham was the father-in-law of Rabbi David Twer-
            sky of Talna; for more on him, see Nezer Yisrael va-Ateret Avraham, published in
            Torat ha-Hasidim ha-Rishonim, edited by Menahim Mendel Viznitzer (Bene-

            37. It is a scholarly commonplace that Hasidic hagiography must be used with
            great caution as a historical source. Nevertheless, a number of highly regarded
            studies do rely on this genre, at least to some degree. See for example Arthur
            Green’s Tormented Master, which draws extensively on the Bratslav literature on
            Rabbi Nahman. For Green’s discussion of the methodological issues, see pp. 6–14.
            Immanuel Etkes makes extensive use of the first Hasidic hagiographical collec-
            tion, Shivhei ha-Besht, for his study of the Baal Shem Tov in Ba’al Hashem: The
            Besht—Magic, Mysticism, Leadership (Jerusalem, 2000), pp. 217–265. In contrast to
            other scholars who treat Shivhei ha-Besht with great suspicion, Etkes, in a lengthy
            excursus on Shivhei ha-Besht as a historical source, concludes that “a significant
            proportion of the stories brought in this collection can be categorized as testi-
            monies and reliable traditions anchored in the personal experiences of the Besht
            and his circle” (p. 265).
            The entire issue is discussed by David Assaf in his biography of Rabbi Israel of
            Ruzhin (see above, n. 31). After noting the characteristics typical of hagiography,
            such as avoidance of problematic topics, apologetic intent, naivete, exaggerations,
            and imagination (Regal Way, pp. 8–28), Assaf nevertheless concludes that the crit-
            ical scholar cannot disregard this genre but must take advantage of it by “sepa-
            rat[ing] the wheat from the chaff. . . . [I]n any source that is not prima facie
            unacceptable, there is a core of truth grounded in factual reality” (p. 26). Of spe-
            cial importance for our purposes is Assaf ’s statement that “Although the pro-
            nouncements attributed to Rabbi Israel and stories about him were published
            many years after his death, it is assumed as a rule that the material is basically
            authentic, although perhaps not as actually worded” (23).
            Assaf and others have pointed out examples where specific hagiographic asser-
            tions have received surprising confirmation in newly discovered historical materi-
            als. It now seems clear that the very reason that Hasidic hagiographic writing is
            often so tendentious—namely, the deep esteem and reverence of the writer for the
            tsaddik—is precisely the impetus for collecting and preserving traditions about the
            master with great care and zeal. In this paper we will assume that the stories about
            the Ruzhiner and his family are in large measure genuine traditions transmitted
            orally or in writing, sometimes for several generations, but that their mode of pre-
            sentation and contextualization may reflect the interests and perspective of the
            final editor or anthologist. It is therefore appropriate and necessary to read with
            attention to anomalies, silences, gaps, and suppressed voices. See above, note 32.
            Most important for our purposes is that the editor of the collections from
            which we will quote often provides a named source for his stories. As Etkes and
            others have noted, this type of attribution is generally quite reliable; it is not at all
            the case that the editor is simply making up names or an attribution chain. See
            the next note.

            Assaf, Regal Way, p. 34. Zak says that he heard this story from Rabbi Israel of
            Medzibozh. Not to be confused with the Besht, this is Israel Shalom Yosef of
            Medzibodz (1852–1911), a descendent of Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel of Apta

            Rabbi Menahem Nahum had served in Prohobitch before arriving in Chernobyl;
            thus Chava’s family had deep roots there and her husband’s tenure was in some
            sense picking up on family ties from the previous generation.

            40. According to Aaron David Twersky, Sefer ha-Yahas mi-Chernobyl ve-Ruzhin
            (Lublin, 1938; reprinted Brooklyn, 1990), Rabbi Mordecai was already living in
            expansive style during his father’s lifetime. During a visit to his son, Rabbi Mena-
            hem Nahum observed “gold and silver vessels and many clocks,” and asked what
            need there was for such things (p. 5, #3). Rabbi Mordecai is said to have replied
            with reference to Rabbi Judah the Patriarch, who according to the Talmud was
            surrounded by abundance yet maintained a personal asceticism (see B.T. Ketubot
            104). Whatever the historicity of this family tradition, it sheds light on how
            Hasidism viewed the opulent lifestyle of the tsaddikim: Rabbi Judah the Patriarch
            is remembered as the editor of the Mishnah as well as a revered and effective
            communal leader who related to Roman rulers on equal terms; he embodied
            “Torah and worldly grandeur in one place.” It should also not be overlooked that
            Davidic descent was claimed for Rabbi Judah the Patriarch.
            Twersky also states that Rabbi Mordecai of Chernobyl’s tenure as tsaddik
            lasted “about fifty years” (p. 102, #1). If correct, this suggests that not only Rabbi
            Mordecai’s lifestyle but his aristocratic court system may have originated during
            his father’s lifetime. Rabbi Mordecai died in 1838; fifty years earlier brings us back
            to 1788, almost ten years before Rabbi Menahem Nahum’s death in 1797 (see
            Arthur Green, Menahem Nahum of Chernobyl, pp. 24–25). Other sources, how-
            ever, say that Rabbi Mordecai led his community for about forty years; this would
            place the beginning of his tenure about the time of his father’s death. See, for
            example, Moshe Chaim Kleinman, Mazkeret Shem ha-Gedolim (Brooklyn, NY,
            1976; original 1907); the text has no pagination but the passage appears at the very
            end of the section devoted to Rabbi Mordecai.

            42. Immanuel Etkes has described the attempt of Rabbi Menahem Mendel of
            Vitebsk and Rabbi Abraham of Kalisk to lead White Russian Hasidism from Eretz
            Israel in the 1780s. Their efforts were largely unsuccessful because Hasidim simply
            began traveling to the courts of other tsaddikim in Volynia and elsewhere.
            Immanuel Etkes, “The Rise of Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Lyady as a Hasidic
            Leader,” Tarbiz, Vol. 54, No. 3 (1985), pp. 430–439.
            In recent years we have the example of Hasidic communities after the Holo-
            caust. Almost without exception, it was only where a scion of the dynasty sur-
            vived the war that the community was able to reconstitute itself, generally in
            Israel or America. The fate of Alexander Hasidism is instructive: before World
            War II, it was one of the largest groups in Poland. But no dynastic heir survived
            to rebuild the community, and the remnant of Alexander Hasidim generally affili-
            ated with dynasties that had a living tsaddik, typically Ger.

            48. A version of this story is found in Kerem Yisrael, which states that the
            meeting took place in Prohobitch at the time when Rabbi Shneur Zalman “was
            returning from [St.] Petersburg,” presumably after his release from prison in 1801
            (p. 58, #4). But if he was returning home to White Russia after his ordeal in St.
            Petersburg, he would hardly have gone by way of Prohobitz, roughly 1000 miles
            to the south. The location in Berdichev is mentioned by the grandson of Rabbi
            Shneur Zalman, Rabbi Menahem Mendel Schneerson (“the Zemah Zedek”), in
            Derekh Mitzvotekho (Brooklyn, NY: Kehot Publication Society, 1991); significantly,
            the context there is the spiritual symbolism of the union of bride and groom (p.
            277). Hayyim Meir Heilman, Beit Rabbi (Berdiehev, 1903), says the occasion was
            “the wedding” (p. 123). Perhaps Heilman is referring to the betrothal of Israel and
            his wife-to-be, Sarah, which took place in Berdichev in 1803. Some say that the
            magnificent betrothal celebration was arranged by Rabbi Levi Yitzhak of
            Berdichev himself, and it is at least plausible that Rabbi Shneur Zalman might
            have made the journey to attend the reception in honor of the great-grandson of
            his master the Maggid of Mezhirech. For more on the betrothal and the versions
            of the story, see Assaf, Regal Way, pp. 33–35 and notes.

            54. Ner Yisrael, Vol. 4, p. 58, #15, citing Kelilat Hen. Hasidic sources routinely
            deny that yihus—noble ancestry—alone can impart spiritual perfection to prog-
            eny. At most, ancestral merit may ease the pathway to spiritual attainment, but only
            when combined with personal striving; see Rabbi Kalonymos Kalman Epstein of
            Cracow, Ma’or va-Shemesh (Jerusalem, 1992), Vol. 2, p. 412, Parashat Naso, s.v. “Va-
            Yedaber Ha-Shem el Moshe.” The same master states that “a talismanic practice
            (segualah) for having good children is to picture in his mind, during sexual inter-
            course, the image of tsaddikim.” Therefore, when a man marries a woman of distin-
            guished lineage (cf. B.T. Ta’anit 31a), “during intercourse, he should picture in his
            mind the image of the tsaddikim of her family whom he has become familiar
            with.” Ma’or va-Shemesh, Vol. 2, p. 751, comment on B.T. Ta’anit 31a. See also idem,
            Vol. 1, pp. 42–43, s.v. Ve-Avraham ve-Sarah zekenim . . . At the same time, this
            author, when discussing the tsaddik’s power to channel blessing like the prophets
            of the Bible, notes that “the tsaddik has the power to transmit this to his disciple
            . . .” and makes no mention of transmission from father to son. Ma’or va-Shemesh,
            Vol. 2, p. 575, Parashat Re’eh, s.v. Od ba-pesukim ha-nizkarim le’el . . .
            The transmission of leadership and charisma from a master to disciple rather
            than to the master’s children is already discussed by the early midrash in relation
            to the biblical narrative of the succession from Moses to Joshua (Num. 27: 15–23).
            Commenting on Num. 27: 22, Midrash Sifrei Zuta, edited by H. S. Horovitz
            (Jerusalem, 1992, p. 321), states that Moses appointed Joshua “with joy”; “As he
            bequeathed his glory to Joshua, Moses was as happy as a man bequeathing his
            property to his sons.” On the broader issue of the role of lineage in the rabbinic
            world, see Jeffrey L. Rubenstein, Talmudic Stories: Narrative Art, Composition, and
            Culture (Baltimore, 1999), chapter 6, “Torah, Lineage, and the Academic Hierar-

            59. Ner Yisrael, Vol. 4, p. 363, quoting Darash Moshe of Rabbi Moshe Kohlen-
            berg. Abraham Bromberg claims that Rabbi Israel did not attend the burial, but
            this is hardly credible. Bromberg is apparently the first author to make this asser-

            62. Yehuda Leib Levin, known by his pen-name Yahalal, was a grandson of the
            tsaddik Rabbi Moshe of Kobrin. As a child, he showed great promise with impres-
            sive knowledge of Talmud and Hasidism; his embrace of the Haskalah scandal-
            ized the Hasidic community and caused great anguish to his family. See Wolf

            edge of the ancient hebrew language and literature, and to regenerate the spirit of
            the nation. Editor & Publisher, W. Schur.” I have followed the orthographic idio-
            syncrasies of the original. Levin’s article appeared in two installments, #23 (March
            23, 1900), p. 4; and #24 (March 30, 1900), pp. 3–4.

            forty, and she was about twenty-three.

            70. Later sources tell an even more complicated story: there were some Sto-
            liner Hasidim who were inclined to follow Sarah Devorah’s older son, named Yer-
            ahmiel Moshe. He was about fourteen at the time of his stepfather’s death and
            had recently married. According to these reports, the Stolin elders were fearful
            that Yerahmiel Moshe might emerge as leader, in effect absorbing the Karlin-
            Stolin lineage into that of Kozienice. It was to forestall such an outcome that the
            elders moved to proclaim the five year old Israel Perlow as Rebbe. See Ya’akov Yis-
            raeli (Kula), Bei Karlin-Stolin, pp. 256–257; see also Stolin: Sefer Zikaron, edited by
            A. Avtihai and Y. Ben-Zakai (Tel Aviv, 1952), pp. 151–155. But even if we accept this
            version, one can hardly doubt Sarah Devorah’s central role in the unfolding of
            events, given that she was mother of both candidates!

            72. Assaf simply says that “the use of the funds was at the sole discretion of the
            tsaddik (or of his representative)” (Regal Way, p. 287). In some sense this is prob-
            ably true, but it sheds little light on the actual administrative structure and proce-
            dures of the household. See also his remark that “Any surplus money was invested
            by the tsaddikim or their financial advisors” (p. 295). But who were those finan-
            cial advisors?

            73. Stella Tillyard writes about the family estates of aristocrats in England
            with their “complex command structure,” employing up to several hundred peo-
            ple, including a core of professional artisans and a hierarchical staff of servants
            who had servants of their own. Tillyard writes about one such estate: “Cumber-
            some, leaky, and above all expensive, the household at Carton creaked through
            the years like an ageing man-of-war, industrial in its scale and cost, a centre of
            employment and production” (Aristocrats [New York, 1994], p. 106). Mutatis
            mutandis, this picture illuminates the situation of the large Hasidic courts in
            their heyday.

            76. There is a clear parallel here to the lavish country residences of the Russian
            nobility which, as Priscilla Roosevelt has shown, expressed ideals of culture, fam-
            ily wealth, and status, and embodied the relationship between land-ownership
            and political power (Life on the Russian Country Estate [New Haven, 1995], p. 3).
            It is certainly suggestive that, as Roosevelt notes, “[a]lmost all the great houses
            were built between the mid-eighteenth and mid-nineteenth centuries, and the
            majority were constructed during the nobility’s brief ‘golden age’” (p. xii)—the
            decades just before and just after 1800, a time span remarkably coincident with
            the period under discussion here, when the great Hasidic lineages arose and
            flourished. This implies that the Hasidic adoption of aristocratic ways and resi-
            dences was more than just a lifestyle choice, but embodied a sense of noble lin-
            eage, a heraldry of rank to be transmitted from generation to generation.

            77. Compare Tamara Haraven’s observations on the close relationship between
            “family time” and “social time” in women’s lives in “The Family as Process: The
            Historical Study of the Family Cycle,” Journal of Social History, Vol. 7 (1974), pp.
            322–329; quoted in Jane Lewis, “Women, Lost and Found: The Impact of Femi-
            nism on History,” in Men’s Studies Modified: The Impact of Feminism on the Acad-
            emic Disciplines, edited by Dale Spender (Oxford, 1981), pp. 55–72. We would
            expand this horizon to include sacred time and sacred space as well: the embod-
            ied theology of the Hasidic court can be understood only when all these dimen-
            sions are viewed as a unity. The adoption of such a perspective would force a
            reassessment of the role of women in Hasidic life.
