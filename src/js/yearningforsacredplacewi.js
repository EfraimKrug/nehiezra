          In Souls on Fire, Elie Wiesel begins his chapter on the School of Pshiskhe with the
          story of Eizik son of Yekel of Kraków, who dreams of treasure in Prague, but after his
          journey discovers that the treasure is really to be found in his own home. <span className="SuperScript">2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; The point
          of the story is not, as is sometimes suggested, that since the treasure you seek is really
          already inside of you, you don’t need to make the journey, nor even that you need to
          make the journey in order to discover that the truth is inside you. Recall that, as Wiesel
          writes, Rabbi Simha- Bunam of Pshiskhe would tell this story each time he accepted a
          new disciple. <span className="SuperScript">3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Rabbi Bunam did accept disciples; he did not send them all back home
          where they came from. Apparently Rabbi Bunam wanted precisely those disciples who
          realized that they didn’t have to be there, who knew that their spiritual growth was in
          their own hands, not in those of the master they had sought out. The tale reflects on
          the School of Pshiskhe, its culture and values, the independence and boldness of spirit
          it sought to cultivate. In this understanding, the story and the journey, the tale of the
          rabbi of Pshiskhe and his disciples, each inform the other, reflect the other, interrogate
          the other, assist in defining the other.

          This story on the complex interaction of rebbe, Hasid, story, and place is a good
          point of entry for our inquiry into Wiesel’s contribution to our understanding of Ha si-
          dism. Nearly all accounts of Hasidism point to the centrality of the zaddik in the move-
          ment. The zaddik is link between heaven and earth, conduit of blessing, center of his
          community, in some sense the center of the world itself. <span className="SuperScript">4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; We also know of the impor-
          tance of stories in Hasidism. From the earliest period hasidic tales conveyed the values
          of the movement and highlighted the role of the zaddikim. Hasidic storytelling is en-
          dowed with ritual holiness and has performative power; the telling of a story creates
          its own sacred space. <span className="SuperScript">5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; My goal here is to explore the complex relationship between zad-
          dikim, the tales, and hasidic reconstruction of sacred place, all in light of the work and
          contribution of Wiesel.

          The Nineteenth Century

          </div>
          <div className="PDFBody">

          While the zaddik and the story were central to Hasidism from its very inception, both
          institutions continued to develop. Roughly around 1800, the zaddik’s charismatic leader-
          ship became hereditary; among other factors, the Polish- Russian pattern of inheri-
          tance of noble estates may have served as a model. <span className="SuperScript">6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; In tandem with this development,
          the zaddik’s place of residence took on a new importance. Throughout the nineteenth
          century and into the twentieth, certain small and otherwise undistinguished provin-
          cial towns— shtetlach— won fame as the home of great masters, the seat of their lin-
          eage’s court. <span className="SuperScript">7</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; This continued even after the death of the founder of the lineage, since
          the zaddik’s residence would typically be revered as a shrine. <span className="SuperScript">8</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; The belief was that the
          spirit of the master was still present at the residence, in the court, at the grave or sep-
          ulcher. Known as the Ohel (“Tent”), the burial place would be visited for petitionary
          prayer and during yahrtzeits, the anniversary dates of the passing of the saintly family
          members interred there. <span className="SuperScript">9</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
          <br/><br/>
          </div>
          <div className="PDFBody">
          Thus the rebbe’s presence made the town into a hasidic center. He became in ef-
          fect the town’s patron, responsible for its spiritual stature and material blessing. <span className="SuperScript">10</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; In-
          deed, the town oft en owed its reputation and place on the map of the hasidic world to
          the rebbe who bore its name. (At a still later period, as we shall see, this relationship
          would sometimes survive the physical dislocation of the rebbe and even the destruc-
          tion of its Jewish residents.)
          <br/><br/>
          </div>
          <div className="PDFBody">
          In a parallel manner, the role of hasidic storytelling continued to evolve through-
          out the nineteenth century. The stories of a particular lineage encapsulated the collec-
          tive wisdom of the school where they were told and the dynasty that preserved them.
          Tales pointed to core hasidic values as embodied in the life of the court. When the in-
          di vidual Hasid reached a situation similar to that of the tale in some respect, he may
          have heard in the tale the voice of his rebbe, providing inspiration and encourage-
          ment as well as perspective and direction. The guidance received from a tale thus as-
          sisted the Hasid to act with wisdom and integrity, consistent with the ethos and values
          of the lineage to which he was affiliated. For example, stories in the Chabad- Lubavitch
          school tend to emphasize Torah knowledge, Divine omnipresence, and uncompromis-
          ing fearlessness in carrying out the will of God as understood by the rebbe. The combi-
          nation of talmudic scholasticism, contemplation of divine immanence, and militancy
          in praxis create the characteristic profile of Chabad Hasidism, and this signature is re-
          flected in Chabad’s fund of stories and tales. In this way, the function of the hasidic
          tale, the function of the court, and the function of the zaddik vis- à- vis the Hasid dove-
          tailed and mutually reinforced each other. The rebbe told the tales and embodied their
          wisdom, while the shtetl became the destination around which the tales turned and
          where they would be heard most authentically and fully. Each dynasty’s storehouse of
          hasidic tales helped define its identity in the constellation of the hasidic world. <span className="SuperScript">11</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Wiesel’s writings on Hasidism illustrate this interaction with poetic beauty. Listen
          to his evocation of Worke in Somewhere a Master, in the chapter titled “The School of

          Note the invocation of the place- name four times, as a metonym for a style of hasidic
          living, a culture of spirituality meticulously defined and lovingly honed. This anaphora
          where no zaddik has yet been named identifies the hasidic culture entirely with the
          locale, the shtetl. The chapter titles of Somewhere a Master reflect the subtle change
          that took place as the movement matured through the nineteenth century: “Pinhas of
          Koretz,” “Aharon of Karlin,” “Wolfe of Zbarazh,” “Barukh of Medzibozh,” “Moshe-
          Leib of Sassov,” “The Holy Seer of Lublin,” “Meir of Premishlan,” “Naphtali of Rop-
          shitz,” until the ninth and last chapter, “The School of Worke.” The name of each of the
          first eight chapters is comprised of the master’s given name and the place with which he
          was most closely associated. Both the person and the place are important, yet it seems
          that the main emphasis is on the master, while the place- name assists in his identifica-
          tion and is subordinate to him. But when we get to Worke (the last chronological stage
          of this series), the place name serves as rubric for the school as a whole; the shtetl and
          the masters who lived and taught there are now nearly identical. <span className="SuperScript">13</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; This relationship be-
          tween zaddik, place, school of hasidic culture, and collection of tales evolved slowly and
          clearly emerged only in the mid- to- late decades of the nineteenth century.

          <div className="PDFBody">
          One aspect of the zaddik’s role is to set the tone for his community’s spiritual experi-
          ence. This leadership includes choices and emphases in liturgy, Torah study, perfor-
          mance of commandments, and in particular, the characteristic rites of hasidic life such
          as the third Sabbath meal, the singing of melodies, and the like. <span className="SuperScript">14</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; The effective hasidic
          leader conveys a characteristic style, orchestrating his court’s spiritual experience. <span className="SuperScript">15</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Often the master bequeathed this style to his successor, and in some cases the style was
          carried forward for a number of generations. Chabad- Lubavitch provides a salient ex-
          ample, but it is far from being the only one.

          Each major lineage developed its own distinctive culture and its particular reputa-
          tion in the constellation of Hasidism as a whole. For one group it was piety, for another
          sweet melody, for a third fervent prayer, or scholarship, or social welfare and care for
          the poor, or austere nobility, or efforts to redeem captives unjustly imprisoned, and so
          on. In the School of Pshiskhe, the reputation surely included individualism and inde-
          pendence of spirit; Modzitz was famed for its musical compositions and singing; while
          Worke evoked the mystic transcendence of silence. Wiesel’s chapter on Worke shows
          how that lineage made silence emotionally expressive, even eloquent. The silence at
          Worke had its own musical tempo, phrasing, dynamics, even surprise.

          The Twentieth Century

          <div className="PDFBody">
          The zaddik’s role as sacred pivot of his community was concretized in the court itself,
          whose material patterns and structural design displayed hasidic theology in schema-
          tized, graphic form. By means of this embodied social theology, the dynastic principle
          gave prominence to what would otherwise have been very modest locales. Throughout
          the nineteenth century hasidic centers fostered a protected domain where a quiet and
          unhurried Hasidism could flourish, luxuriating in a sacred space far from the pace
          and pressures of urban life. All this changed in the twentieth century, with the move
          to large cities such as Warsaw, especially during and after World War I. <span className="SuperScript">16</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; During this
          period we encounter the phenomenon of rebbes named for towns in which they no
          longer reside.
          <br/><br/>
          </div>
          <div className="PDFBody">
          But after World War II and the Holocaust, these towns as places of Jewish life
          no longer existed at all. The question then became, can a hasidic lineage survive the
          physical dislocation of the rebbe and then the destruction of the Jewish residents of the
          town whose name the lineage bears? The answer to this question depended on the fate
          of the zaddik himself. In general the corporate identity of a hasidic community does
          not long survive without direct personal contact with a living master. With the living
          master, there is stability and continuity, a natural focus for the community’s efforts to
          regroup and rebuild. Almost without exception, it was only when a dynastic scion sur-
          vived the war that a particular hasidic community was able to reconstitute itself. The
          postwar hasidic leaders who survived the Shoah and relocated to West ern Europe, Is-
          rael, or the West ern hemisphere saved the cohesive communities built by their ances-
          tors from dissipation. Crystallized around family loyalty and the memory of great pre-
          decessors, the community’s identity remained intact. And the lineage’s identity was
          also anchored in place: a socially constructed place, the shtetl that no longer existed. <span className="SuperScript">17</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
          The postwar hasidic master thus achieved a new role and prominence. One may
          assert that in the entire history of Hasidism, after the eighteenth- century foundational
          period, the hasidic master is never more crucial than in the post–World War II period.
          In this period, the lineage’s story (now in clud ing the story of war trauma and survival)
          and the person who embodies the story mutually reinforce each other as never before.
          The dynastic narrative (re)constructs the place where the dynasty began, thus giving
          the incumbent rebbe his identity and his mission. The postwar rebbe is largely a crea-
          tion of the story of his dynasty, whose shtetl no longer exists. The relationship is re-
          ciprocal since the story and the place can continue only with a rebbe. If there were noYearning for
          Lubavitcher Rebbe in the postwar period, there would be no Lubavitch Hasidism today.
          The same is true of Satmar, Ger, Bobov, Belz, Viznitz, Skver, Karlin- Stolin, Munkacs,
          and so on. <span className="SuperScript">18</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;

          that postwar Lubavitch is not a place but an atmosphere, in this case the atmosphere
          surrounding the Lubavitcher rebbe, and created largely by him. “Lubavitch” is wher-
          ever the rebbe is, and wherever there is a hitkashrut to the rebbe. When uttering the
          word “Lubavitch” nowadays, almost no one thinks of a town in Russia. What comes to
          mind is rather an address in Crown Heights, Brooklyn: 770 East ern Parkway, or simply
          “770.” This location is linked to a far- flung network of Chabad houses through out the
          world established by the rebbe, and staffed by idealistic men and women who continue
          to be motivated by their bond to the rebbe even after his death in 1994.

          An early, and still arresting, portrait of a postwar hasidic community revived and led

          rebbe leading a Farbrengen. A major focus of the gathering is song. Wiesel writes,
          The hasidim sang. The song burst their chests and lit a thousand flames in their
          eyes. . . . At the far end of the room, facing the door, the Rebbe surrounded by his
          court, presided over the table of honor. . . . All those present feared and admired him
          and pledged him fidelity without limit, limning the forces which converged in his
          person and which he alone could put to use. . . . The hasidim followed him with ra-
          diant confidence . . . Let him walk first; liberation was at hand! And so they danced

          In his memoir All Rivers Run to the Sea, <span className="SuperScript">22</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; writing of Rabbi Menahem Mendel Schneer-
          son, the Lubavitcher rebbe, Wiesel acknowledges that the hasidic celebration described
          in The Gates of the Forest “was his celebration. The songs, vows, and fervor of the faith-
          ful were such that I felt as if I were with my own rebbe, back in my hometown.”
          The memoir tells of a visit to Lubavitch (that is, to 770 East ern Parkway in Brook-
          lyn) one year during Simchat Torah. Wiesel stood at the entrance, hoping to avoid at-
          tention. Suddenly the rebbe noticed him and beckoned him, calling him by name; the
          Hasidim carried him over the heads of the crowd and deposited him “like a package”
          in front of the rebbe, who smiled at him. Wiesel recalls the ensuing dialogue as follows:
          “Welcome,” he said. “It’s nice of a Hasid of Wizhnitz to come and greet us in Lubavitch.
          But is this how they celebrate Simchat Torah in Wizhnitz?” “Rebbe,” I said faintly,
          “we are not in Wizhnitz but in Lubavitch.” “Then do as we do in Lubavitch,” he said.
          “And what do you do in Lubavitch?” “In Lubavitch we drink and say lehayim, to life.”
          “In Wizhnitz too.” “Very well. Then say lehayim.” He handed me a glass filled to the
          brim with vodka. “Rebbe,” I said, “in Wizhnitz a Hasid does not drink alone.” “Nor
          in Lubavitch.” He emptied his glass in one gulp. I followed suit.

          <div className="PDFBody">
          When the great Rabbi Israel Baal Shem- Tov saw misfortune threatening the Jews it
          was his custom to go into a certain part of the forest to meditate. There he would
          light a fire, say a special prayer, and the miracle would be accomplished and the mis-
          fortune averted.

          Later, when his disciple, the celebrated Magid of Mezritch, had occasion, for the
          same reason, to intercede with heaven, he would go to the same place in the forest
          and say: “Master of the Universe, listen! “I do not know how to light the fire, but I
          am still able to say the prayer.” And again the miracle would be accomplished.
          Still later, Rabbi Moshe- Leib of Sasov, in order to save his people once more,
          would go into the forest and say: “I do not know how to light the fire, I do not know
          the prayer, but I know the place and this must be sufficient.” It was sufficient and the
          miracle was accomplished.

          Then it fell to Rabbi Israel of Ruzhin to overcome misfortune. Sitting in his arm-
          chair, his head in his hands, he spoke to God: “ I am unable to light the fire and I do
          not know the prayer; I cannot even find the place in the forest. All I can do is to tell
          the story, and this must be sufficient.”

          Gershom Scholem concluded his great survey Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism <span className="SuperScript">23</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; with
          this story as he heard it from Shmuel Yosef Agnon. Scholem says, “You can say if you
          will that this profound little anecdote symbolizes the decay of a great movement. You
          can also say that it reflects the transformation of all its values, a transformation so
          profound that in the end all that remained of the mystery was the tale.” <span className="SuperScript">24</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; But Wiesel’s
          deployment of the story suggests something very different. The master remains cen-
          tral, indeed more central than ever before. A charismatic zaddik such as the Ruzhiner
          brings the story to life; his storytelling is an act of conjuration, a channeling of power,
          a translation of lost place to a new location, ultimately a revelation of the salvation em-
          bedded in the tale.

          There are interesting variations between the story as presented in English versions
          and that of the earliest published Hebrew version, Reuven Zak’s Kneset Yisrael of 1906.
          One line from Zak that is missing in Scholem but is implicit in The Gates of the Forest
          is this: “The Maggid said, ‘The mystical intentions and prayers of the Baal Shem Tov
          I don’t know, but I will act by relying upon the Baal Shem Tov’s intention; and this too
          was accepted by Heaven” (Hebrew: Ha- yihudim ve- hakavvanot she- kivven ha- Besht
          eini yode’a, rak e’eseh al semakh ha- kavvanah she- kivven ha- Besht, ve- nitkabel gam ken
          [emphasis mine]). <span className="SuperScript">25</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is clear that this reliance, this leaning, this placement into prox-
          imity, this concatenation from zaddik to zaddik going back to the Baal Shem Tov, is
          key to the efficacy of the rite and the story. It is not the story alone that has power, it is
          the latter- day saint grasping on to what is beyond his own reach: the contemplations
          of his uniquely illuminated predecessor, the Baal Shem Tov, known through out Hasi-
          dism as “the Light of the Seven Days of Creation,” that is effective. <span className="SuperScript">26</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;

          <div className="PDFBody">
          It is worth noting that when this story was told, the Ruzhiner dynasty was no longer
          in Ruzhin in Russia. It had long since relocated to Sadeger in the Austro- Hungarian
          empire; after the First World War it was to be found largely in Vienna, and after the
          Second World War in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem’s Meah Shearim, and New York. <span className="SuperScript">27</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; So Ruzhin
          is no longer in Ruzhin, just as Lubavitch is no longer in Russia. Lubavitch and Ruzhin
          reside with their respective rebbe— in some sense, they are the rebbe.

          The introduction to Legends of Our Time (1968) describes Wiesel’s visit to the Viz-
          nit zer rebbe in Bnei Brak. The meeting was uncomfortable and tense; the rebbe ap-
          parently disapproved of Wiesel’s postwar life choices. In the eyes of the Viznitzer, the
          young writer compared unfavorably with his grandfather Dodye Feig, a fervent Hasid
          of the old school. Yet the rebbe remembered Wiesel and recognized him instantly. And
          the rebbe’s presence in Bnei Brak, Israel, was not just ghostly nostalgia but living wit-
          ness and promise. He had founded and led a community that rose from the ashes and
          flourished. The vignette of the meeting concludes by describing the Viznitzer’s bless-
          ing (quite different from, yet still parallel to, that of the Lubavitcher rebbe): “Dodye
          Feig’s grandson should not go away empty- handed. Come and I shall give you my bless-
          ing.” Wiesel remarks: “And I did not dare remind him that for so many years I have
          tried so hard to acquire for myself a name which needed to be blessed, too. Only after
          I had left him did I realize that perhaps the time has come for Dodye Feig’s grandson
          to take my place at the typewriter.” This suggests that despite the gap that may have
          existed— at least in the pious zaddik’s perception— between himself and the worldly
          writer, the blessing nevertheless took effect and did its work. Perhaps because of the
          rebbe’s challenge- cum- blessing, the writer is prodded to more clearly express his own
          voice. The blessing has found its mark even if its aged bestower seems to be laboring in
          opacity.

          We now come to the matter of lost childhood and the endless, futile quest for a de-
          stroyed home. In his most celebrated work, Night, Wiesel describes the deportation of
          the Jews of Sighet, an event that set into motion the murder of most of Sighet’s Jews,
          and that ended forever the town’s identity as a place of Jewish residence, as a shtetl.
          The memory of Wiesel’s loved ones has been a constant theme in his writing, but so
          has the memory of his town. Indeed, he has returned, or attempted to return, to his
          birthplace time and again, but each attempt is painful, inconclusive, unfulfilled, be-
          cause the Jewish town he seeks (as opposed to the geographical location) has been not
          just destroyed but erased.

          In Legends of Our Time, <span className="SuperScript">28</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Wiesel collected a group of essays. One of the first es-
          says in the book, titled “My Teachers,” notes that “After the war I had several opportu-
          nities to return. . . . I did not return” (9). Yet a later chapter, “The Last Return,” indeed
          describes a postwar visit to Sighet, in the mid- 1960s. He dreaded the return because
          “that town they were talking about no longer existed. It had followed the Jews into de-
          portation” (112). Their very memory had been erased: “The Jews have been driven not
          only out of the town but out of time as well” (127).

          The visit is accompanied by pain, disappointment, even elements of farce. A dog
          barks, startles him, and chases him out of his own backyard. In One Generation After, <span className="SuperScript">29</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
          where he picks up this narrative, Wiesel describes going to the garden to dig up the
          gold watch he received as a bar mitzvah gift. He finds the watch and takes it, then feels
          compelled to go back and rebury it because taking it made him feel like a thief. <span className="SuperScript">30</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
          The longing to return to the town of his youth motivates many passages in Wie-
          sel’s writing, and remains present in his life. <span className="SuperScript">31</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; The very last page of the sec ond volume

          There is a deep connection between the futile search for a hometown erased from
          history, on the one hand, and the recognition of the role of zaddikim in Hasidism’s
          postwar rebirth, on the other hand. Childhood memories are intimately intertwined
          with the sense of self, one’s feeling of place in the world. <span className="SuperScript">33</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is true that every return to
          a childhood home is fraught with disappointment brought about by the inevitability
          of change. But typically change is incremental, accretive, usually most visible at the
          margins. In Sighet and hundreds of other towns of Jewish Europe, however, the rup-
          ture was sudden, total, irreversible. Everything ended in the course of a day. Others
          inhabited the place where Jews had lived and worked for hundreds of years; traces of
          the earlier residents disappeared. There was almost no “back” to go to; the erasure wasYearning for
          nearly complete. If there was to be a future, it had to be constructed somewhere else,
          yet it could be done only by telling the tale of what had once been.

          So it was that surviving hasidic masters in their way, and Wiesel in his way, were
          engaged in parallel projects during the postwar years. This connection is brought home
          in Wiesel’s account of a return to Sighet in the early 1970s. The most intense moment
          was entering his childhood house. He recounts:

          What made me realize that I was not at home? A spot on the wall. When the
          Wizsnitzer Rebbe died in 1936, we received his photo. He was a beautiful man. I re-
          member putting the nail in the wall and hanging the rebbe’s picture on the wall. The
          nail was still in the same spot— with a crucifix on it. And when I saw it, I realized if
          there is no room for the Wizsnitzer Rebbe in my home, there is no room for me ei-
          ther. And I ran out of the room, out of my home, out of my childhood. <span className="SuperScript">34</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;

          The “Wizsnitzer Rebbe” of whom Wiesel speaks here (the town’s spelling varies) was
          Rabbi Israel Hager, born in 1860; the Viznitzer of the Bnei Brak visit recounted in Leg-
          ends of Our Time was Israel’s son, Rabbi Hayyim Meir Hager (1888–1972). It was the
          latter Hager who survived the war, emigrated to the land of Israel, and founded Kiryat
          Wizhnitz in Bnei Brak, said to be the first hasidic neighborhood since the establishment
          of the State of Israel. <span className="SuperScript">35</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; The dismay of Wiesel’s aborted return to his home is capped by
          the realization that his beloved rebbe’s picture has been replaced by a crucifix. And yet,
          the rebbe had a son who revived Viznitz as a thriving community, Viznitz- in- Israel.
          And the child who nailed the photo on his wall was now a celebrated writer and lec-
          turer, teaching and engaging new communities of learners, translating and transport-
          ing Hasidism.

          If the child of Sighet was able to find so clear and compelling a voice despite the
          erasure of Jewish Sighet, this was due in part to the ongoing relationship with rebbes—
          the rebbe of Lubavitch, elsewhere than in Lubavitch; and the rebbe of Viznitz, but not
          in geographic Viznitz. And Wiesel, by the power of his pen and voice, has been able,
          in some way, to bring Sighet and all of Jewish Europe back to life, but not in Sighet.
          We thus return to the story with which we began, the story of Eizik son of Yekel
          told by Rabbi Simha- Bunam of Pshiskhe. Eizik’s treasure was not to be found away
          from home, not even in Pshiskhe, but it was the zaddik of Pshiskhe who transmitted
          this wisdom and told the story to each new disciple. The school of Pshiskhe showed
          how the teacher- storyteller— that is, the zaddik— and the story itself dovetail; their mu-
          tual illumination absorbed and encapsulated the meaning of Pshiskhe as a hasidic des-
          tination. What started out as a geographic center became a climate of the spirit that
          could be transported and reconstructed anywhere. Perhaps that is why, as modernity en-
          croached upon and challenged Hasidism ever more aggressively and violently, offshoots
          of the school of Pshiskhe— Kotsk, Ger, Izbica, Sochachov, Amshinov, and others— have
          proved resilient, vibrant, able to renew their voice and their vision in new circum-
          stances and geographic locations, speaking powerfully in a fresh idiom. In truth, any
          hasidic dynasty that was able to rebuild after nearly complete destruction has absorbed
          and lived this lesson.

          Wiesel show the way such a study must be undertaken— by focusing on the personali-
          ties of the rebbes, who were able to sing the old- country songs in new lands, who not
          only told stories but became stories themselves.

          Souls on Fire has a deeply moving chapter on Rabbi Israel of Ruzhin. One memo-
          rable story does not appear there but was told by Wiesel in a Boston University class; it
          might be called the Story of the Pipe. I present the story here, as closely as I can recall
          it, in tribute to Wiesel as a great teacher, uniquely gifted to bring Hasidism alive in the
          classroom:

          A hasid of the Ryzhiner, in order to expand what was already a moderately success-
          ful enterprise, needed to make a business trip to Paris. A hasid never leaves without
          first getting his Rebbe’s blessing, but in this case the hasid was hesitant to go to the
          Ryzhiner, mindful of Paris’s reputation as a center of impious behaviour. He did fi-
          nally approach his master. To his surprise, the Ryzhiner blessed him enthusiasti-
          cally, telling him that his trip would be crowned with success, and that in addition
          he would suffer no spiritual ill effects or adverse influences in Paris. As the audience
          was ending, the Rebbe grasped the hasid’s hand warmly and said, “By the way, when
          in Paris would you mind picking up a nice pipe for me? I’ll be happy to pay you.” The
          hasid responded, “No, of course it will be my gift to the Rebbe!”

          <div className="PDFBody">
          Apparently the Rebbe’s blessing was effective: the hasid was busy every minute
          in Paris, contacting suppliers and meeting customers. He even found a synagogue
          that conducted services according to his custom. He returned to Ryzhin laden with
          merchandise and new business ideas. Just outside the town, tired but happy, he re-
          membered the Rebbe’s request— the pipe! He insisted that the carriage turn back and
          go to the nearest large town with a smoke shop, where he purchased the best pipe in
          the store. Entering Ryzhin once again, he went to greet the Rebbe even before going
          to his own home. He reported to the Rebbe on the success of his visit and that thank
          God he did not succumb to any of the temptations of the big city. And then, without
          making any claims about its origin, he presented the Rebbe with the pipe. The Rebbe
          smiled and said, “Yankel, please be seated. I have two questions to ask you. Number
          one, don’t you think I know where you got the pipe? And number two, do you think
          I really wanted a new pipe? What I wanted was that when you would be in Paris that
          you would remember that you have a Rebbe in Ryzhin.”

          This Ruzhin story highlights the centrality of hiskashrus, of bonding with one’s master
          over space and time. The story is self- referential, suggesting that the story itself can
          foster and maintain hiskashrus. One can be in Paris but can live in Ruzhin. One can
          live in Boston or New York and live in Lubavitch and Viznitz.Yearning for
          The world has shifted violently and irrevocably. But in the face of disruption, dis-
          placement, and erasure, Hasidism has survived and even flourished by reconstituting
          itself around the triad of zaddik–story–place. Wiesel has described this process in a
          compelling, persuasive manner; he has lived it. His sensitivity to the power of person,
          place, and narrative may be behind his unforgettable prophetic assertion, the moment
          of speaking of truth to power, when he said to a U.S. president, “That place is not your

          7. Jeremy Dauber has shown convincingly that early hasidic stories generally avoid realistic rep-
          resentation of spatial location. He argues that the reason for eschewing mimetic representation is
          ideological: “representation, description at a distance, mediated texts, is no substitute for direct con-
          tact with the Zaddik . . . , who is able to perceive ‘the real truth’ and to articulate it.” Jeremy Dauber,

          erature,” in Shtetl: New Evaluations, ed. Steven T. Katz (New York: New York University Press, 2006),
          140–78; the quote is on 147. But Dauber focuses on Shivhei HaBesht and Rabbi Nachman’s Tales, both
          published around 1815; it is the change that takes place as the nineteenth century unfolds that we are
          tracing here. The process whereby hasidic zaddikim became increasingly identified with Polish towns
          and cities and oft en came to control them is vividly described by Glenn Dynner in Men of Silk: The
          Hasidic Conquest of Polish Jewish Society (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006).

          Mossad Harav Kook, 1969); English translation: Nehemia Polen, ed. and trans., The Rebbe’s Daugh-

          sidic Zaddik,” in Celebrating Wiesel: Stories, Essays, Reflections, ed. Alan Rosen (Notre Dame: Uni-
          versity of Notre Dame Press, 1998), 123–40.
          9. See the description in Rebbe’s Daughter, 139–41.
          10. The economic aspects of Hasidic Royal Courts are vividly described by David Assaf in The
          Regal Way: The Life and Times of Rabbi Israel of Ruzhin, trans. David Louvish (Stanford, Calif.: Stan-
          ford University Press, 2002); see esp. 267–324.
          11. Steven Katz has written of the need for attending to the role (that is, the social function) of re-
          telling tales in hasidic life, as well as considering the differences between the vari ous hasidic lineages.
          See Steven T. Katz, Post- Holocaust Dialogues: Critical Studies in Modern Jewish Thought (New York:
          New York University Press, 1985), 77. Joseph Dan, in The Hasidic Story— Its History and Development
          [in Hebrew] (Jerusalem: Keter, 1975), 235–38, distinguishes between collections of hasidic tales pub-
          lished by maskilim and other “outsiders,” in contrast to tales collected and published by “insiders.”
          These latter tend to focus on one lineage— the one of which the editor is an adherent. These efforts,
          Dan observes, are in effect monographs on the lineage and its masters, tend to downplay the miracu-
          lous and fabulous, and contain much of solid his tori cal value. It may be added that these collections
          tend to highlight the wisdom of the particular lineage’s masters as captured in their aphorisms and
          parables, and the vignettes told about them.
          12. Wiesel, Somewhere a Master: Further Hasidic Portraits and Legends (New York: Summit Books,
          1982), 175; emphasis and formatting mine. I have attempted to hear these words as they likely were
          spoken by their author; it should be recalled that most of the published essays were delivered orally,
          and that the poetic cadences— and silences— are an important aspect of Wiesel’s powerful eloquence.
          13. There is a similar pattern in Souls on Fire where the chapter called “The School of Pshyshke”
          comes after ten chapters whose headings name an early master or his disciples.
          14. On this see A. Wertheim, Law and Custom in Chassidism [in Hebrew] (Jerusalem: Mossad
          Harav Kook, 1960).
          15. The role of hasidic masters in orchestrating melody during prayer services was noted by the
          early anti- hasidic polemicist David of Makov. Writing about Rabbi Hayyim- Heikel and his court in
          Amdur during the years 1773–87, he quotes an enthusiast as follows: “Our Rebbe has a very sweet voice
          and knows how to sing songs as do all those who pray with him. . . . Our master Heike’s honey- toned
          melodies are surpassingly pleasing. He beats time with both his hands, clapping them together, as
          [the hasidim] respond in harmonious chorus.” See Mordecai Wilensky, Hasidim and Mitnaggedim,
          vol. 2 (Jerusalem: Bialik Institute, 1990), 173; Wolf Zeev Rabinowitsch, Lithuanian Hasidism (New
          York: Schocken Books, 1971), 128. A recent article that explores linkages between musical conduct-
          ing and charismatic spiritual leadership is Stephen Cottrell, “Music, Time, and Dance in Orchestral
          Performance: The Conductor as Shaman,” Twentieth- Century Music 3, no. 1 (2007): 73–96.
          16. The displacement of Abraham Joshua Heschel’s aristocratic hasidic family from the country-
          side to major cities such as Vienna and Warsaw during the Great War is described by Edward Kaplan
          and Samuel Dresner in Abraham Joshua Heschel: Prophetic Witness (New Haven, Conn.: Yale Uni-
          versity Press, 1998). See esp. 34 on the relocation of Heschel’s uncle, Rabbi Alter Israel Shimon Per-
          low, to Warsaw. Throughout his Warsaw years until his death in 1933, this saintly fig ure was known
          as the “Novominsker Rebbe.”
          17. Joseph Dan has noted that the main factor securing the miraculous contemporary rebirth
          of hasidic communities in the aftermath of the Holocaust was “adherence to their hereditary tzad-
          dikim.” See Joseph Dan, “Hasidism: The Third Century,” in Jewish Mysticism, vol. 4: General Charac-
          teristics and Comparative Studies (Northvale, N.J.: Jason Aronson, 1999), 67–85; “The Contemporary
          Hasidic Tzaddik: Charisma, Heredity, Magic, and Miracle,” ibid., 111–30.
          18. The fate of Alexander (Alexandrov, near Lodz) Hasidism is instructive as a counterexample.
          Before the Second World War, it was one of the largest hasidic groups in Poland, rivaling Ger in num-Yearning for
          bers and influence. But while the Gerer rebbe escaped to Eretz Israel and began the rebuilding of his
          community, almost all the Danziger heirs were killed, and Alexander has to this day not recovered
          its former prominence. See Tzvi M. Rabinowicz, The Encyclopedia of Hasidism (Northvale, NJ: Jason
          Aronson, 1996), 84, s.v. “Danziger, Yitzhak Menahem Mendel, of Alexander (1880–1943).”

          The fourth chapter of Gates of the Forest is about Brooklyn, the Farbrengen, and my idealized
          image of a Hasidic rebbe, the Lubavitcher Rebbe. I describe how we met, how I came to the
          first Farbrengen. I describe our first conversation, which lasted hours. At one point I asked
          him point blank, “Rebbe, how can you believe in Hashem after the Khourban? He looked at
          me and said, “And how can you not believe after the Khourban?” Well, that was a turning
          point in my writing, that simple dialogue.

          26. A similar point is made by the lead story in Yaffa Eliach’s Hasidic Tales of the Holocaust (New
          York: Oxford University Press, 1982). The story, told by the rabbi of Bluzhov, Rabbi Israel Spira, is
          one of survival by means of a seemingly impossible feat, jumping over a large, yawning pit. The frail
          rabbi and a friend close their eyes, jump, and make it to the other side alive. As Eliach tells the story,
          the rabbi’s young friend asks him:
          “Tell me, Rebbe, how did you do it?”
          “I was holding on to my ancestral merit. I was holding on to the coattails of my father,
          and my grandfather and my great- grandfather, of blessed memory,” said the rabbi and his
          eyes searched the black skies above. “Tell me, my friend, how did you reach the other side of
          the pit?”
          “I was holding on to you,” replied the rabbi’s friend. (3–4)
          27. There are several books tracing the twentieth- century history of the multibranched Ruzhin
          dynasty as it moved into the modern world. These works, written by dynastic insiders, are entirely
          appreciative and noncriti cal, but contain much valuable information. See, for example, Menachem
          Brayer, The House of Rizhin (New York: Mesorah Publications, 2003); Yisroel Friedman, The Rebbes
          of Chortkov (New York: Mesorah Publications, 2003).

          31. The number of index entries in the memoirs under “Sighet, EW’s return visits” as well as those
          in Against Silence suggest the prominence of this yearning.
          32. Elie Wiesel, And the Sea Is Never Full: Memoirs 1969–, trans. Marion Wiesel from the French
          (New York: Knopf, 1999), 410.

          bany: State University of New York Press, 1994).
          34. Against Silence, 3:41; compare All Rivers Run to the Sea, 72. Notable in this connection is the
          account in All Rivers, 12–13, on the elder Rabbi Israel of Viznitz’s last visit to Sighet, where he is said
          to have told Wiesel’s mother: “Sarah, know that your son will become a gadol b’Israel, a great man
          in Israel, but neither you nor I will live to see the day.” This would have taken place sometime in the
          mid- 1930s.
          35. According to Tzvi M. Rabinowicz, The Encyclopedia of Hasidism (Northvale, N.J.: Jason Aron-
          son, 1996), 165.
          36. For now, see Janet S. Belcove- Shalin, ed., New World Hasidism: Ethnographic Studies of Ha-
          sidic Jews in America (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1995). Belcove- Shalin’s chapter
          “Home in Exile: Hasidism in the New World,” 205–36, has a fine sketch of the Bobover rebbe and his
          achievement in reestablishing a flourishing Bobover community in Boro Park, Brooklyn; also note-
          worthy is the chapter by Solomon Poll, “The Charismatic Leader of the Hasidic Community: The
          Zaddiq, the Rebbe,” 257–75. See also Jerome R. Mintz, Legends of the Hasidim: An Introduction to
          Hasidic Culture and Oral Tradition in the New World (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1968);
          idem, Hasidic People: A Place in the New World (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1992).
          There are many popu lar works on postwar Lubavitch in Brooklyn and warmly appreciative sketches
          of the rebbe, but the topic awaits a full scholarly treatment that would place due weight on Rabbi
          Menahem Mendel Schneerson’s thought and voluminous teachings as well as on his extraordinarily
          charismatic personality and communal achievements. Shaul Shimon Deutsch, Larger Than Life: The
          Life and Times of the Lubavitcher Rebbe Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, 2 vols. (New York: Cha-
          sidic His tori cal Productions, 1995–97), reproduces many rare primary documents and is a treasure
          trove of information, but this multivolume biography has thus far covered only Rabbi Schneer son’s
          early years. Elliot R. Wolfson has made an important contribution to our appreciation of the depth,
          subtlety, and power of Rabbi Schneerson’s thought with his Open Secret: Postmessianic Messianism
          and the Mystical Revision of Menahem Mendel Schneerson (New York: Columbia University Press,
          2009). Also worthy of note is Maya Balakirsky Katz, “On the Master- Disciple Relationship in Ha-
          sidic Visual Culture: The Life and Afterlife of Rebbe Portraits in Habad, 1798–2006,” Images: A Jour-
          nal of Jewish Art and Visual Culture 1 (2007): 55–79. Katz insightfully remarks that Rabbi Menahem
          Mendel Schneerson forged “a post- Shoah group identity around a distinctly Ameri can leader who
          was also the spiritual repository of the six preceding Russian leaders” (55, abstract)
          37. On the Bitburg affair, see And the Sea Is Never Full, 225–50, esp. 238.ELIE WIESEL
