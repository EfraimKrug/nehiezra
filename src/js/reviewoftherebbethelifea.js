          George Orwell began his essay on Gandhi by saying that ‘‘Saints
          should always be judged guilty until they are proved innocent, but
          the tests that have to be applied to them are not, of course, the
          same in all cases.’’<span className="SuperScript">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;In their study of the modern Hasidic leader
          Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, revered by his followers as a
          saintly master, Samuel Heilman and Menachem Friedman execute the
          first half of Orwell’s maxim with vigor, but they stumble over the
          second half. Repelled by what they see as a cult of personality, they
          deconstruct the cult but lose sight of the personality. Their effort displays
          the limits of a journalistic portrayal of a person of spirit that
          observes externals but vacates considerations of interiority.

          The Rebbe provides a vivid portrait of Rabbi Schneerson’s early
          days, beginning with his childhood in Russia, noting that he was
          sent to a relatively modern school, where the curriculum included
          grammar and poetry, including Bialik.<span className="SuperScript">2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Later we find the future
          leader in Berlin, a place that the authors stress was not congenial to
          Hasidic life; they suggest that the choice of Berlin bespeaks an attraction
          to Western culture and cosmopolitan life. Countering some
          claims, the authors point out that Schneerson’s academic achievements
          in Berlin were modest; although Friedrich Wilhelm University granted
          him a certificate of attendance, he never advanced beyond the status
          of auditor.<span className="SuperScript">3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Later in Paris, he eventually did receive a degree, not
          from the Sorbonne, but from a second-tier engineering school. Also,
          his academic record was hardly distinguished; at one point, he had a
          class ranking of thirty five out of thirty seven.<span className="SuperScript">4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;

          Focusing on the location of his residences in Berlin and Paris, the
          authors deduce that at some point the young Schneerson’s attachment
          to the Hasidic way of life was tenuous and desultory; they speculate
          that he and his wife (Moussia, the daughter of the sixth Lubavitcher
          Rebbe Yosef Yitzhak Schneerson) likely spent time enjoying the cultural
          resources and bohemian atmosphere of Paris. Distancing
          themselves from the Jewish quarter and a small Hasidic synagogue,
          they lived in a more avant-garde area, not far from Sartre and de
          Beauvoir, Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas, Picasso and
          Modigliani. The authors ask leadingly, ‘‘Could the Schneersons . . . have
          remained completely ignorant of this life around them? Did they want
          to be? Did they never walk the boulevards, stop in the cafés, visit the
          galleries, or feel the energy around them? Had this couple who stayed
          out late in Leningrad while they were courting and who may have
          attended the theatre there become homebodies in interwar Paris?’’<span className="SuperScript">5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;

          The second part of the book describes how Menachem Mendel
          Schneerson emerged to follow his father-in-law as the seventh Rebbe
          of Chabad, a process that they see as filled with posturing and intrigue,
          and the now familiar story of messianic fervor orchestrated
          by Rabbi Schneerson and the campaign to disseminate Chabad teachings
          and establish Chabad centers throughout the world, a campaign
          that has enjoyed astonishing success. But how did an aspiring engineer
          with a lackluster academic record and an uncertain connection to his
          Hasidic heritage, a displaced refugee who had barely avoided the Nazi
          vortex, make his way in a new country with an unfamiliar language
          and culture, eventually to become the leader of a flourishing worldwide
          religious movement? The answer according to Heilman and
          Friedman is self-reinvention and shrewd manipulation: ‘‘From being
          a somewhat mediocre mechanical and electrical engineer he would
          become an outstanding social and spiritual engineer who would
          offer his recipe for the redemption of the Jewish people.’’<span className="SuperScript">6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
          He ‘‘outflanked’’ his brother-in-law for the leadership,<span className="SuperScript">7</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;and then ‘‘he had to
          reinvent himself. He would do it by stressing his knowledge of
          Lubavitcher sources and by using mystification to enhance his charisma
          and the charisma of his office—audiences with him began at
          10 p.m. and ran into the wee hours of the morning, so that people
          who came to see him had to walk through abandoned streets when the
          rest of the world was asleep and specially prepare themselves and
          remain awake for the encounter.’’<span className="SuperScript">8</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;

          The authors are keen to emphasize the discontinuity between his
          life in Western Europe, where they claim his aim was to ‘‘live as a Jew
          of Hasidic background pursuing a career in engineering,’’<span className="SuperScript">9</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;and his
          subsequent American leadership role. In Berlin he had lived, as they
          put it, a ‘‘double life,’’<span className="SuperScript">10</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;and while they note that his interest in
          Hasidism began to grow during his last years in Europe, they portray
          that interest as compelled by circumstance as much as by inner desire:
          ‘‘Clearly, as his prospects for a career as an engineer declined,
          Mendel’s possibilities for and interest in a vocation in the court of
          ChaBaD grew. This, he surely recognized by the end of the 1930s, was
          something he could do.’’<span className="SuperScript">11</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
          And after the war, ‘‘ he would become a renewed almost reborn person in America [emphasis in original]; he
          would no longer be Mendel Schneerson, would-be French engineer
          and student. As we have seen, by 1951 he would be reinvented and
          remade. No longer the shy introvert, he became the self-confident
          extrovert and leader, emerging as Grand Rabbi Menachem Mendel
          Schneerson, shlita . . . , the seventh Lubavitcher rebbe.’’<span className="SuperScript">12</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;

          Is this plausible, a mountebank as Hasidic master? Turning oneself
          into a rebbe by effort of will and trompe l’oeil? With the omniscient
          voice of a biblical narrator, Heilman and Friedman presume access to
          Schneerson’s inner motivations, framed in flat and pedestrian terms.
          They write as if Schneerson’s emergence as Hasidic leader was a makeover
          engineered by a career counselor. Why would anyone go along
          with such posturing, agreeing to see a minor engineer-turned-rebbe in
          the dead of night? It is here that Heilman’s and Friedman’s project
          runs aground: the first part of their book is so intent on deflating
          Schneerson’s aggrandized image, bringing him down to earth, that
          one is at a loss to understand how his followers were inspired to
          spread his message to every corner of the earth.

          It is even harder to see how he could have left a powerful impression
          on movement outsiders who were not sympathetic to the messianism
          and who were likely dismissive or even actively hostile to it. For
          such is the case. In his memoir All Rivers Run to the Sea,<span className="SuperScript">13</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Elie Wiesel
          writes of the influence of Rabbi Menahem Mendel Schneerson on his
          life and work. He tells of a visit to Lubavitch (i.e., to 770 Eastern
          Parkway in Brooklyn) one year during the holiday of Simchat Torah.
          The vignette of their encounter is richly drawn, conveying deep
          mutual affection and respect. At the end of their dialogue the
          Rebbe says, ‘‘You deserve a blessing. Name it!’’ Wiesel hesitates and
          the Rebbe continues, ‘‘Would you like me to bless you so you can
          begin again?’’ Wiesel was struck by the Rebbe’s wisdom, since ‘‘[t]o
          begin again could mean so many things: begin again to drink, to pray,
          to believe, to live. And then it was Simchat Torah, which is also my
          birthday.’’
          <br/><br/>
          </div>
          <div className="PDFBody">
          This episode affected Wiesel deeply. He presents the exchange as
          unplanned, spontaneous. The multivalent suppleness and playful
          capaciousness of the Rebbe’s blessing, all delivered on the spur of the
          moment, disclosed penetrating discernment, and fresh possibility.
          Did the Rebbe know that Simchat Torah is Wiesel’s birthday? Was it
          sheer luck, a stab in the dark, or prodigious memory of prior meetings
          summoned and applied in a flash? The Simchat Torah gathering was
          dominated by a mood of buoyant festivity, but elsewhere Wiesel writes
          of other meetings when the subject of the Holocaust came up. Wiesel
          states that his dialogue with the Rebbe on that topic ‘‘was a turning
          point in my writing.’’<span className="SuperScript">14</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Wiesel did not become a Lubavitcher, but that
          is just the point: Schneerson’s ability to touch souls was not limited to
          movement insiders, to those in thrall to his image and mystique.
          Encounters similar to the ones with Wiesel took place all the time,
          day after day, for decades. It is their incrementally cumulative effect
          that endowed the man with the stature he came to have.

          Former Israeli Chief Rabbi Israel Meir Lau devotes a lengthy section
          of his memoir to the Lubavitcher Rebbe.<span className="SuperScript">15</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rabbi Lau describes
          his first audience with the Rebbe, which began at 1:30 a.m. on a day in
          March 1974, lasting over two hours. Far from being annoyed at the
          time of the meeting, Rabbi Lau—hardly a Lubavitcher Hasid—describes

          Yedidya Frankel. ‘‘As the rebbe strode quickly into the hall, a small
          book by Maimonides under his arm, the atmosphere was electric. The
          rebbe gave a class that lasted four hours, without using notes or opening

          But he had never seen ability such as that of the Lubavitcher
          Rebbe. He quotes his father-in-law as saying, ‘‘I witnessed the magnificence
          of Polish Jewry; I had the honor of visiting Rabbi Kook, who

          Another former Chief Rabbi who attributes to Schneerson a

          Sacks recalls that, in the summer of 1968, while still a student at
          Cambridge University, he traveled to the United States, where he
          met ‘‘the greatest rabbis alive,’’ Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik and Rabbi
          Menachem Mendel Schneersohn. As he puts it, those meetings were
          ‘‘life-changing encounters. Rabbi Soloveitchik had challenged me to
          think. Rabbi Schneersohn had challenged me to lead . . . .[T]hese

          These glowing words from savvy outsiders are not adduced here
          for reasons of pious sentimentality but to do justice to the historical
          record, to correct a category error. The small-bore portrait of a middling
          careerist is wildly at variance with the assessments of astute non-
          Hasidic observers. Reading Heilman and Friedman, one could not
          guess that Moshe Idel, in his study of recent Jewish mystical thought,
          ranks Schneerson as one of the major Jewish cultural and intellectual
          leaders emerging from the Eastern European milieu in the twentieth
          century, alongside Agnon, Soloveitchik, and Heschel, and, for a
          slightly earlier period, Abraham Isaac Kook, Bialik, and Zeitlin.<span className="SuperScript">21</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the eminent historian of American Judaism, Jonathan
          Sarna, in his description of Schneerson mentions, ‘‘deep Jewish learning,
          native brilliance, personal charisma, boundless energy, extraordinary administrative skills, and intimate family connections that
          equipped him to succeed in his job.’’<span className="SuperScript">22</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarna goes on to describe
          the fervent messianism and the mitzvah campaign in nuanced, balanced terms.

          <div className="PDFBody">

          Here we come to a keyword in the authors’ exposition: charisma.
          They write that ‘‘Menachem Mendel Schneerson combined both the
          charisma of his office as Rebbe of ChaBaD Lubavitch and a more
          personal charisma, in virtue of his powerful personality and
          extraordinary individual magnetism.’’<span className="SuperScript">24</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;They explain charisma as ‘‘the
          possession of extraordinary personal characteristics, charm, and magnetism
          that inspires people to admire or even love, follow, obey . . . .’’<span className="SuperScript">25</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Gesturing to Max Weber, they mention charisma’s routinization and
          fret about how long borrowed charisma can keep the movement going
          in the Rebbe’s absence. However, genuine as opposed to manufactured
          charisma cannot be conjured by an act of will to buttress a
          project of self-reinvention. As Clifford Geertz notes with dismay in
          an essay titled, ‘‘Centers, Kings, and Charisma: Reflections on the
          Symbolics of Power,’’ in our day, a politician or a rock star may be
          called charismatic, ‘‘mainly on the grounds that he has contrived to
          interest a certain number of people in the glitter of his personality.’’<span className="SuperScript">26</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
          But it is precisely a quality of the numinous, not contrivance or self-presentation, that so many discerning people found in Schneerson
          and that served to propel his influence. Jonathan Sacks is at pains to
          point out that what one felt in the presence of Soloveitchik and
          Schneersohn was not a simulacrum of ‘‘charisma’’; rather one sensed
          ‘‘a kind of humility. In their presence you could feel the divine presence.’’ ‘‘Both conveyed the gravitas and depth of the Jewish soul.’’

          <div className="PDFBody">

          Shmuel N. Eisenstadt writes in his introduction to Weber’s On
          Charisma and Institution Building that charismatic fervor ‘‘is rooted in
          the attempt to come into contact with the very essence of being, to go
          to the very roots of existence, of cosmic, social, and cultural order, to
          what is seen as sacred and fundamental.’’<span className="SuperScript">27</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Eisenstadt quotes at length
          from Edward A. Shils, who notes that charisma depends on being
          perceived as being closely connected to some central feature of the
          cosmos and its power. Shils remarks that charisma may be attained
          through ‘‘reflective wisdom,’’ and that even those who do not possess
          it nevertheless may appreciate it and feel the need for proximity to
          those who more fully inhabit the cosmic center, since ‘‘their own
          weaker responsiveness is fortified and heightened’’ thereby.<span className="SuperScript">28</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
          <br/><br/>
          </div>
          <div className="PDFBody">
          For Rabbinic Judaism in general and Habad Hasidism in particular, the cosmic center and source of power is knowledge of Torah in
          all its aspects. Drawing on Eisenstadt’s work, the Israeli sociologist
          Aryei Fishman notes the charismatic power of Torah in Jewish religious life, and observes that Torah can be ‘‘the source of order and
          authority when a religious order breaks down,’’<span className="SuperScript">29</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;that is,
          when conventional religiosity proves inadequate for a new situation. Thus,
          ‘‘religious consciousness—the consciousness that perceives itself as
          knowing the will of God—can view Torah as charisma either
          innovatively or conservatively.’’<span className="SuperScript">30</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;And as Shaul Stampfer writes, ‘‘The very
          possession of talmudic knowledge gave the scholar charisma and this
          was irrespective of more conventional sources of charisma, such as
          appearance, bearing, or personality.’’<span className="SuperScript">31</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Stampfer observes that this
          ‘‘charisma of knowledge’’ is enhanced by wide exposure to challenging
          classical texts, since it is firsthand knowledge of the difficulties that
          increases the prestige of those few who excel.<span className="SuperScript">32</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;

          </div>
          <div className="PDFBody">
          Schneerson’s charisma was grounded in his commanding knowledge of the rabbinic canon, including Talmud, Midrash, Maimonides’
          Mishneh Torah, as well as Zohar and the voluminous theoretical treatises of Habad Hasidism; all of this in on display in the thirty-nine
          collected volumes of Sichos, extended expositions on exoteric themes,
          as well as the more esoteric Ma’amarim, which take up and develop
          aspects of the abstract and enigmatically paradoxical Habad
          theology.<span className="SuperScript">33</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;

          Stampfer has pointed out that, ‘‘[i]n east European Jewish society
          it was possible, though not common, for a scholar to study in isolation
          until he was ready to make his mark on the scholarly world.’’<span className="SuperScript">34</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Stampfer cites the case of
          Naftali Tsevi Berlin (1817–93), who ‘‘transformed himself into a major scholar known particularly for the broad
          scope of his knowledge,’’ as a result of a lengthy period of
          sequestration in private study. Another example, not mentioned by Stampfer,
          is Avraham Yesha’ayahu Karelitz, known as the ‘‘Hazon Ish’’ (1878–
          1953). The excellent biography of Karelitz by Benjamin Brown points
          out that the young Karelitz studied essentially by himself and was
          almost completely unknown before his immigration to the Land of
          Israel at the age of fifty five.<span className="SuperScript">35</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Heilman and Friedman entirely miss
          the context, the much broader phenomenon of young prodigies from
          prominent rabbinic families in Eastern Europe going to Berlin and
          working to integrate Western learning with their own heritage. Hillel
          Goldberg’s Between Berlin and Slobodka<span className="SuperScript">36</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;follows the transitions made
          by Isaac Hutner, Joseph B. Soloveitchik, and Abraham Joshua Heschel,
          among others. Soloveitchik had studied Rabbinics privately with his
          father for twelve years, learning the characteristic conceptual approach
          to Talmud study of his grandfather, Rabbi Hayyim Soloveitchik.
          Goldberg points out that ‘‘[p]rior to university, then, Joseph Baer
          Soloveitchik never went to school.’’

          More recently, we have the biography of Heschel by Edward

          young scion from a great Hasidic family can be profoundly attracted
          to Western learning and culture while maintaining an intense and
          abiding commitment to Hasidism. As Kaplan writes in a summary
          statement of powerful concision, Heschel was a ‘‘university-educated
          East European Jew inspired by God.’’<span className="SuperScript">38</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;For all the differences between
          Heschel and Schneerson, precisely the same statement should be
          made about Schneerson; and one wishes that Heilman andFriedman had done so.

          During the Berlin and Paris years Schneerson indeed kept himself
          in seclusion, but this isolation permitted intense inner work. To be
          sure, there are dangers when religious formation takes place without
          much peer contact, but the examples of Soloveitchik, Karelitz, and
          Heschel, among others, demonstrate that some extraordinary religious
          personalities are able to flourish and reach full stature outside the
          conformity and regimentation of the yeshiva world. As Brown makes
          clear in his study of Karelitz, the long period of self-sequestration and
          focused study was fueled not only by prodigious intellect, depth of
          spirit, and infinite capacity for conceptual labor but also by a clarity of
          purpose and sharply defined sense of self that sustained and refreshed
          a horizon of aspiration for decades. In the secular world, one can
          think of the analogy of famous technology visionaries who quit college
          to work in a garage, eventually emerging with creative concepts and
          products that transformed the world. Rather than seeing Schneerson’s
          relative isolation as indifference to Hasidic culture, it was more likely a
          decision to develop away from the distractions and conformity of the
          Hasidic community itself. The Schneersons saw themselves as nobility,
          indeed, the spiritual aristocracy of the Jewish world. As with most
          aristocracies, there is not only noblesse oblige and communal concern
          but also patrician reserve and a carefully calibrated distance. At a
          point in their lives when they were not ready to take on a more
          public role, the young couple may have chosen to live away from
          the main Jewish area precisely to ensure that they would not be
          pestered by overly enthusiastic, curious Hasidim.

          The rules are indeed different for royalty, and most commoners
          have no problem with that fact. The average Hasid living in poverty
          did not resent the holidays in Marienbad their rebbes took with their
          families and entourage; on the contrary, they found self-esteem in the
          royal treatment their master received and took vicarious pleasure in
          the trips. As David Assaf notes in his study of Rabbi Israel of Ruzhin,
          Ruzhin Hasidim took pride in their rebbe’s regal lifestyle, which, it was
          said, he adopted for reasons of state and in which he took no personal
          pleasure; as Assaf puts it, ‘‘his conventions of nobility and kingliness
          were accepted by his hasidim and viewed with affection.’’<span className="SuperScript">39</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;

          Heilman and Friedman occasionally mention reports of
          Schneerson’s grasp of Habad teachings but these remain vague and
          muffled, and the authors never adequately address Schneerson’s rabbinic mastery. The silence on the key matter of scholarship skews their
          entire effort. In the fall of 1964, Schneerson began a multiyear series
          of discourses, known as sichos, explicating Rashi’s commentary on
          Torah, developing and applying a consistent set of rules and interpretive practices. The Rashi sichos, which number in the hundreds,
          constitute an impressive analytical corpus on the great medieval commentator.
          The sichos trace Rashi’s sources in Talmud and Midrash,
          noting how Rashi shapes and molds his materials for his purposes.
          They draw upon the rich library of Rashi supercommentaries and
          arrive at original conclusions regarding Rashi’s meaning and intent.
          Each Rashi sichah is a tour de force of learned exposition. To be sure,
          Schneerson’s exegetical principles would be unlikely to find acceptance
          in the academy. For example, he posited that Rashi’s words
          always convey meaning accessible to a five-year-old child and at the
          same time encode a deep esoteric layer.<span className="SuperScript">40</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet in their richness, scope,
          sustained creativity, and vigor, they are a remarkable body of work.
          And—unusual for these circles—Rabbi Schneerson consulted and deployed
          variant readings based on manuscripts available to him.<span className="SuperScript">41</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;

          The rabbi’s sustained focus on Rashi would have provided fertile
          grounds for analysis had Heilman and Friedman taken note of it. For,
          as Avraham Grossman observed in his seminal study of Rashi, key
          elements of Rashi’s worldview included the uniqueness of the Jewish
          people, a special loving regard for the sanctity of the Land of Israel,
          and poignant messianic longing.<span className="SuperScript">42</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Precisely these elements figure
          prominently in Schneerson’s own thinking. Had they been attentive
          to Schneerson’s scholarly output, they might have traced the antecedents
          of his characteristic ideas in illuminating ways.

          The authors would have done well to spend time with Kaplan’s
          excellent study of Heschel, which evokes the atmosphere of spiritual
          nobility in Hasidic aristocratic families, with homes centered on religious aspiration and spiritual quest. In such homes, every religious act
          was to be performed with mindfulness and a sublime aesthetic, making
          a personal statement of sacredness and reverence that reflected the
          family’s religious signature.

          In Schneerson’s case, a strong indication of this culture is to be
          found in the Reshimos, notebooks from the 1920s and 1930s. Heilman
          and Friedman do mention the notebooks but do not fully grasp their
          significance. Not diaries, the Reshimos actually reflect the inner practices of the Chabad elite and young Schneerson’s faithful recording of
          everything he saw and heard of these practices, largely from his father-in-law, signaling his induction into the Chabad leadership circle. As a
          Schneerson, part of the extended cousinage comprising the descendents of the founders, he was already eligible to join, but now he
          received transmission of practices that were not well known or deliberately kept from public view, making him a true member of Chabad’s
          spiritual elite. And his faithful and lovingly meticulous recording of
          the practices, vignettes, and stories, reflects his desire to internalize
          that elite status, to inhabit it from within. The possibility that the
          young scion of the Schneerson lineage may have had a rich interior
          spiritual life even while pursuing his engineering degree, and that his
          leadership abilities may have grown from the seedbed of that life, is
          not considered by our authors.

          Rabbi Schneerson’s detractors have taken to calling him a ‘‘failed
          messiah.’’ This recalls something Alex Ross wrote about Leonard
          Bernstein. In his acclaimed survey of twentieth-century music
          The Rest is Noise, Ross notes that some critics claim that Bernstein
          ‘‘frittered away his gift amid glitzy conducting dates, media appearances,
          and ‘radical chic’ parties at his apartment in Manhattan.’’ To
          this Ross responds, ‘‘Yet Bernstein’s failures outweighed many others’
          successes.’’<span className="SuperScript">43</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mutatis mutandis, Schneerson’s failure, if such it is,
          outshines the paltry success of so many other erstwhile Jewish leaders.

          This book is helpful as an account of the transformation of
          Chabad from inner-directed to outer-facing, from a lineage that
          prized lengthy contemplative prayer to one that celebrates bold feats
          of outreach. But the biography of Rabbi Menachem Mendel
          Schneerson, when it is written, must not omit his command of the
          entire textual corpus of Rabbinic Judaism; his mastery and creative
          deployment of the paradoxical, intricate, and labyrinthine Chabad
          theological system; administrative proficiency that apparently included
          near-total recall of names, faces, and relevant facts; manifest spiritual
          intensity and boundless energy, displayed in the orchestration of collective rites of numinous transmission; the ability to listen deeply,
          counsel wisely, bring out the best in interlocutors, outsiders as well
          as devotees; and passionate concern for the destiny of the Jewish
          people as he understood it.

          Some might take this as a retrograde lapse into hagiography.
          Quite the opposite: as Orwell suggested, one’s analytical tools must
          be adequate to the subject at hand. With an individual like Menachem
          Mendel Schneerson, a pinched and blinkered approach simply will not
          work, not even as social history. What is most important must not be
          left off the table. The biographer must not confuse inspirational leadership
          with careerism. A hermeneutic of suspicion is called for, but
          one must know of what to be suspicious. For Rabbi Menachem
          Mendel Schneerson, crass ambition and intellectual shallowness are
          not on the list. Only a robust portrait that takes seriously the imaginative
          reach of a great thinker can capture both the possibilities and
          perils of religious leadership. It is not blind piety but the discipline of
          sociology that requires a serious engagement with religious intensity
          and its numinous origins.
