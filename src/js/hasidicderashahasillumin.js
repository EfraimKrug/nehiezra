        Hasidic Derashah as Illuminated Exegesis

        In his lead essay to Mysticism and Sacred Scripture, Steven T. Katz has argued that “[t]he
        role of scripture . . . is essential to the major mystical traditions and to the teachings and
        experiences of their leading representatives.”<span className="SuperScript">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Professor Katz surveys the varied forms of
        mystical scriptural interpretation across esoteric traditions, making ample use of the
        Jewish mystical tradition, especially Zohar. This essay continues his work with a focus
        on hasidic scriptural exegetical texts, the derashot. I will argue that Hasidic derashot
        exemplify active interpretation, and the intimate personal engagement of the inter-
        preter. While mystical receptivity is indeed cultivated, there is also active intervention
        and deliberate recontextualization. The charismatic hasidic interpreter embraces
        sacred scripture in a dynamic personal relationship, with the belief that the recontextu-
        alizing and renewed understanding of verses changes reality itself, moving all in the
        direction of compassion and beneficence. This interpretive posture of personal rela-
        tionship is grounded in a robust individualism that differs from the quest for Ayin, the
        Nothing or Absolute, that has often been emphasized by many scholars of Hasidism.
        <br/><br/>

        <div className="PDFBody">
        Israel ben Eliezer (d. 1760), known as the Baal Shem Tov and considered by
        devotees as the founder of Hasidism, taught that every word of Torah can sustain
        two opposing interpretations, one pointing in the direction of severity,
        and one pointing toward compassion, or the notion that “the righteous transform
        the sense of severity to that of compassion.”
        <span className="SuperScript">2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;   For the Baal Shem Tov, the
        spiritual integrity of the interpreter is more important than intellectual skill
        or knowledge of the canon. When one learns Torah from a teacher of proper
        spirit, then the teaching “is fruitful and multiplies”;
        <span className="SuperScript">3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;  that is, the wisdom is alive
        and robust, reverberating and sparkling with implications, repercussions, and
        transformative power. On the other hand, “When one learns from a wicked
        person, then [even though the message may be correct] it is not fruitful and
        does not multiply, but remains flat, just as the student learned it.”<span className="SuperScript">4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
        In a companion teaching, the Baal Shem Tov argues a complementary point:
        The Torah’s many commandments (613 according to talmudic tradition) can
        all be distilled to the Ten Commandments, and these in turn are rooted in just
        one word, the Anokhi, the “I am” that opens the Decalogue. This process is
        one of unification, of finding the source of the many in the one, and can only
        take place when “the soul of one’s teacher is rooted in the World of Unity; but
        when the teacher’s soul is in the world of Division, then the disciple receives
        teachings that are separate, isolated.”<span className="SuperScript">5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;   This approach to interpretation eschews
        judgments of true/false in favor of fertile/sterile; similarly, teachers are not
        ranked according to mental agility or analytic refinement but by their ability
        to instill awareness of an underlying unity in disparate materials and eventu-
        ally to unity in life perspective. For the Baal Shem Tov, because every word of
        Torah can be taken positively or negatively, the true teacher is responsible for
        bringing the words to the side of good and blessing, comprehending the text
        in the most beneficent way. The active interpreter’s understanding shapes the
        text, transforming the world itself.<span className="SuperScript">6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;

        <div className="PDFBody">
        Prominent third generation master, Rabbi Elimelekh of Lyzhensk (Lezajsk;
        1717–1787), highlights the activist understanding of Torah interpretation in
        Noam Elimelekh: “When a zaddik wishes to exert influence and alter circum-
        stances (in the direction of beneficence), he must attire the desired change in
        the garb of Torah. The Torah raises the matter, presenting it before God . . . By
        means of the Torah, the person can express his desire and make things happen
        in accord with his will.”<span className="SuperScript">7</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Elimelekh defines a hasidic reading as an expression
        of the tzaddik’s active, beneficent desire to channel blessing via the Torah. The
        universal, comprehensive, determinative nature of Torah means that one can
        always find a way to express whatever one needs and wants to express, with the
        assurance that this articulation will lead to the desired result. Beginning with
        the Baal Shem Tov, then, hasidic interpreters have intentionally responded to
        what they perceive as a mandate to express meaning that conveys blessed, joyous possibility.

        <div className="PDFBody">
        One of the most striking articulations of the activist, interventionist mode
        of interpretation is found in the work of Rabbi Yaakov Leiner (1828–1878), the
        second master in the lineage of Izbica-Radzyn. Rabbi Leiner’s teaching appears
        as a comment on Jacob’s dying plea to his son Joseph: “If now I have found
        favor (hen) in your eyes . . . deal kindly and truly with me, and please don’t bury
        me in Egypt.”<span className="SuperScript">8</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Rabbi Leiner asks, “Did not Jacob trust Joseph to fulfill his dying
        request—from a father to a son—to be buried in Canaan, without invoking
        ‘grace’ or ‘favor’?”

        <div className="PDFBody">
        There are places in Torah which on the surface appear uninspiring. To the
        person who just sees their surface meaning, they appear as a lifeless,
        immobile body. Such a lackluster appearance is akin to being buried.
        However, for someone who sees the words of Torah in a gracious, favorable light, there is no passage in Torah that is uninspiring, for by means of
        the gracious regard (hen) he has for Torah, his heart is aligned with and
        resonates with the depth of these seemingly buried passages.<span className="SuperScript">9</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <br/><br/>
        </div>
        <div className="PDFBody">
        In this teaching, Rabbi Leiner sets up a correspondence between Joseph’s
        willingness to transfer his father’s body from Egypt to Canaan and gracious
        readings of biblical texts. From a superficial perspective, it should make no
        difference where a body is buried. After all, the dead can be regarded as so
        much dust, and it should not matter whether the body is placed in one location or another. It is grace—that is, the desire to persist in cherishing ongoing
        relationship grounded in shared memory and future hope—that motivates
        and energizes the project of transferring a body to a preferred location. As
        Jon Levenson explains regarding Jacob’s elicitation of Joseph’s promise,
        “he . . . makes Joseph promise to bury him in the promised land, thus reiterating and deepening familial devotion to the patrimony of which they have yet
        to take possession.”<span className="SuperScript">10</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;   That is, the location of Jacob’s body is indeed significant,
        as it serves to focus the family’s geographical attention and emotional devotion
        elsewhere than Egypt, to the location of its past and its future in Canaan.
        Rabbi Leiner draws out the implications for exegesis as follows: there are
        some sections of Torah that seem dead, that do not arouse interest and appear
        devoid of spiritual meaning. Only a gracious reading reframes, re-deposits,
        spatially translates, re-contextualizes, and restores life to such passages. This
        is a remarkable acknowledgement that there are passages of which one might
        be tempted to merely say, ‘Give them a decent burial.’ Gracious reading opens
        the heart to meaning, bringing frozen passages to warmth and life. One can
        see the whole Izbica project as a sustained and determined act of gracious
        reframing, re-reading of the Torah in its entirety, especially the narrative sec-
        tions that on the surface appear awkward and less than inspiring.<span className="SuperScript">11</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Izbica
        knows where the bodies are buried, and it is not shy about pointing them out,
        digging to reposition them so they may speak with renewed life.

        Another major hasidic lineage of Poland is that of Ger (Gora Kalwaria), in
        whose work we find a similar idea. Rabbi Yehudah Aryeh Leib Alter comments
        on Gen. 28:11, which describes the fugitive Jacob’s “assembling the stones of
        the place” around his head.<span className="SuperScript">12</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;   According to Rabbi Alter, this means that out
        of the fragments of his dislocated life, Jacob arranged an edifice of meaning,
        a coherent conceptual structure, a “Torah of the place.”<span className="SuperScript">13</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Similarly, each generation is bidden to take the particularities of its own place and time, its own
        existential circumstance, and shape them into Torah.<span className="SuperScript">14</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Drawing on an old mystical motif from Sefer Yetzirah that refers to the letters of the Hebrew alphabet
        as stones, and letter permutations as rearranged stones, Rabbi Alter asserts
        that there are some scriptural passages whose meaning is clear, direct, and
        that speak with transparent power; there are other passages whose meaning
        is murky and that call for mindful attention. As the Talmud acknowledges, in
        order to make an exegetical derivation work, elements of the text may need to
        be rearranged.<span className="SuperScript">15</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;   This is an activist, interventionist construction of meaning.<span className="SuperScript">16</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;

        Another aspect of hasidic exegesis might be called a theology of intimate
        perception of the textual surface. Rabbi Moshe Hayyim Efraim of Sudylkow
        (c. 1748–1800), grandson of the Baal Shem Tov, wrote a work called Degel
        Mahaneh Efraim that transmits many traditions from the author’s celebrated
        grandfather. In a discussion of the manna, Rabbi Moshe Hayyim Efraim draws
        an analogy between the “food from heaven” that the Israelites gathered during their wilderness trek, and the task of the interpreter of Torah. His point
        of departure is the following verse “This is the food that God has given you
        for eating . . . gather from it, each person (ish) according to what he eats—
        according to the number of your people, every person (ish) according to whom-
        ever is in his tent shall you take.”<span className="SuperScript">17</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Rabbi Moshe Hayyim Efraim presents a
        parable from his grandfather the Baal Shem Tov, followed by his interpretation.
        While in general the expositions in Degel Mahaneh Efraim are reasonably clear
        as hasidic texts go, this piece is elusive and cryptic, apparently deliberately
        so. The text—both the grandfather’s parable and grandson’s application—is
        presented below in its entirety. While the body of my response to the teaching
        is placed at the conclusion, from time to time I make insertions, marked by
        square brackets, where I feel that interstitial phrases are necessary for understanding. Biblical quotes are set in small caps to assist the reader in seeing
        how the rabbi is nuancing the verse. Finally, I break up the text into paragraphs not present in the original Hebrew, and assign letters to the paragraphs.

        Section (A) announces Rabbi Moshe Hayyim Efraim’s intention to present
        what he deems a profound, esoteric interpretation of Exodus 16:16, as the gesture to Ps. 25:14—often deployed with reference to prophetic revelations—
        makes clear. Nahmanides, in his commentary on the Torah, employs the phrase
        “by way of truth,” al derekh ha-emet, to introduce a kabbalistic interpretation,<span className="SuperScript">18</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
        but it is likely that the author’s primary intention here is more general. He is
        sharing his confidence that what he is about to present is truthful, an accurate assessment of the verse’s inner meaning and, more broadly, of the manna
        motif in scripture. Section (B) introduces the stress on the keyword ‘ish,’ or
        person, which appears twice in Ex. 16:16, and motivates the entire piece’s
        focus on personhood and individuality. It sets the stage for introducing the
        Baal Shem Tov’s parable. Section (C), the parable, will be discussed at length
        below, but at this point it is important to note that the king has multiple
        children, each one with a special virtue; no single child is singled out for unique
        superiority.<span className="SuperScript">19</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;

        <div className="PDFBody">
        In section (D) the author alludes to a Zohar passage <span className="SuperScript">20</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;which adduces
        various terms for humans, such as ish (human being), gever (man), enosh
        (mortal), and asserts that “the greatest of them all is adam.” As demonstrated
        by Gen. 1:27 and 9:6, Adam was made in the image of God. The human task
        is to move oneself to ever-higher levels of being, eventually rising to become
        the true Adam, the divine image. Thus the ‘ish’ of Ex. 16:16 is invited to find the
        manna and savor the taste specifically meant for that person. Absorption and
        integration of that nourishment enables the person to rise to the level of the
        quintessential human, Adam. All this is understood as taking place along two
        linked dimensions: the Israelites’ physical eating of the manna in the Exodus
        narrative, and the interpreter’s attunement to the peculiarities of the text’s surface features, unlocking and accessing its deeper message.
        <br/><br/>
        </div>
        <div className="PDFBody">
        The Hebrew word for taste, ta’am, occurs with reference to the manna at
        Ex. 16:31 (“and its taste was like wafers in honey”) as well as at Num. 11:8 (“and
        its taste was as the taste of a cake baked in oil”), giving rise to the midrashic
        tradition that the Israelites could taste whatever they desired in the manna.
        ‘Taste’ as signifying spiritual experience is already found in the Bible in
        Psalm 34:9, “Taste and see how good the Lord is.” In the medieval period, Judah
        Ha-Levi’s Kuzari invokes taste repeatedly to convey his phenomenology of
        religious experience in contrast to the logical arguments of Jewish philosophy.
        As Diana Lobel writes in her study of Sufi influence on Ha-Levi, “The sense
        of taste is by its very nature unmediated; no second-hand report, however
        eloquent, can convey the actual savor of a feast. Dhawq [taste] is not simply
        a kind of cognition, but an immediate experience accompanied by relishing
        and enjoyment.”<span className="SuperScript">21</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Ha-Levi also mentions the te’amim as masoretic accents,
        and in the following century the Zohar discusses their symbolic significance
        as tropes, melodic modes for scriptural reading.<span className="SuperScript">22</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;   All of this is background
        for Rabbi Moshe Hayyim Efraim’s use of the term. He refers to superscripted
        tropes, te’mamim elyonim, which are applied to notably sublime and majestic
        passages, in particular the Decalogue. With this allusive language, the rabbi
        of Sudylkow implies that scripture is like manna: its taste is unlocked by
        the reader who savors its sublime possibilities. It is precisely the nobility and
        sensitivity that one brings to a passage that frees its inner significance, allowing access and enabling it and the reader to soar together.

        In section (E) the author plays on the Hebrew root s-f-r, associated with
        numbers, as well as with the gemstone sapphire/sapir. The multiple senses
        of this keyword are already exploited in Sefer Yetzirah and early kabbalistic
        texts, where sefirot are the ten divine manifestations.<span className="SuperScript">23</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Here the author is not
        thinking primarily of technical kabbalistic terminology, but the idea that the
        individual’s soul radiates and pulsates as it recognizes affinity with surface
        features designed for it, as these surface phenomena point to a hidden spiritual
        treasure meant specifically for that person.

        Section (F) refers to the writings of Rabbi Jacob Joseph of Polonnoye, an
        early disciple of the Baal Shem Tov whose works preserve the first published
        teachings attributed to the great master.<span className="SuperScript">24</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The specific passage is found in
        Tzafnat Pa’ane’ah, originally published in 1782.<span className="SuperScript">25</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;   This passage details the rabbinic doctrine of resurrection of the dead as well as the biblical prooftexts that
        the Talmud supplies to anchor this doctrine in scripture. Rabbi Jacob Joseph
        of Polonnoye recounts that a certain group of medieval Jews challenged the
        rabbinic readings, pointing out that the verses in question could be read
        differently and that the prooftexts were hardly dispositive. The reply is that the
        yearning for a spiritual state reflects a predisposition for it, an intuitive, tacit
        comprehension that makes the idea congenial. Those individuals who find
        rabbinic prooftexts for resurrection unpersuasive indeed have no affinity with
        that state, which implies that they are not destined for resurrection.
        In Section (G) the rabbi understands the “tent” of Ps. 78:60 in the mystic sense of a nimbus that envelops the individual, known in Kabbalah as
        “surrounding presence” (maqqif ).<span className="SuperScript">26</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Each individual is invited to take and taste
        what is truly theirs by deep affinity so that they may become Adam as in Psalm
        78:60, “ohel shiken ba-adam”—“the tent he had set among men” or, as the rabbi
        suggests we read the verse, “the tent he had set around Adam.” The “tent” or
        maqqif, that is, the envelope encasing one’s personhood, is illumined by affinity with the scriptural passage that speaks most directly to it.<span className="SuperScript">27</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;

        Rabbi Moshe Hayyim Efraim’s conclusion in Section H is moving and poignant. He argues that the parable itself belongs to whoever understands it,
        shines, and resonates with it, whoever discerns and savors both its surface
        and depth more richly. Indeed, the parable has implications that perhaps even
        Rabbi Moshe Hayyim Efraim has not fully grasped. There are always levels that
        only the future will reveal. And the inheritors of the parable may be disciples,
        not necessarily the rabbi’s biological heirs. This point has implications in light
        of hasidic history, which at this time was already moving to a dynastic system
        largely based on filial succession.<span className="SuperScript">28</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The rabbi suggests that the legacy of spirit
        is not limited to any one family tree, and true kinship with scripture’s riches are
        open to whoever perceives them. This is a striking statement coming from the
        grandson of the founder of Hasidism.

        to the real quest and perseveres to find the treasure, the King Himself. In an
        extended essay, Moshe Idel has discussed the famous “Parable of the Son of
        the King and the Imaginary Walls,” often understood as reflecting a pantheistic
        or acosmistic theology, but which Idel sees as expressing a personal relationship between king and son. As he writes, in that parable “no full pantheism is
        assumed, despite the resort to the concept of illusion. There is a center from
        which the light radiates and this center is described in strongly anthropomorphic terms: the face of the king.”<span className="SuperScript">30</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; And, as Idel suggests, in that parable the
        prince confirms his true relationship with the king by overcoming enemies
        and collapsing any supposed distance between son and father. In our parable
        however, there is not just one true son or one correct interpretation. Rather,
        “kol ehad yesh lo ma’alah yeterah zeh mi-zeh”: each child is blessed with a
        faculty that the others do not share; each one’s particular gift invites awareness
        of a specific surface feature encasing a unique treasure. The game is not zerosum; all persons in the quest can find the treasure meant for them and add to
        the rich palette of Torah interpretation.<span className="SuperScript">31</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;

        Mystical readers tend to look for secrets under the surface of sacred text.
        But we have here a theology of the textual surface, a heightened attentiveness
        to exterior aspects that are not perceived as arbitrary, capricious, or misleading. What appears to be scaffolding actually supports a deeper message that
        leads reciprocally to a more powerful appreciation of the surface itself. This
        appreciation is rooted in an epistemology of faith: one must have faith that
        superficial perception actually conforms to deeper phenomena, and one must
        recognize that the surface pattern indicates resonant affinity. When one identifies the surface feature corresponding to the treasure, the soul shines, glow-
        ing with the excitement of discovery and the characteristic frequency of the
        treasure itself.

        The biblical motif of manna is a perfect vehicle for this teaching: the manna’s
        taste was appealing because the savor is a genuine sign of divine favor and
        presence. Already in Psalms, manna is described as “angel food.<span className="SuperScript">32</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; The connection between manna and Torah is ancient. The early midrash Mekhilta
        de-Rabbi Ishmael tells us “only those who eat manna could interpret Torah.<span className="SuperScript">33</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; And
        Shemot Rabbah, a later aggadic midrash, links the revelatory Voice of Sinai—
        which was heard by all recipients according to their absorptive capacity— with
        the manna, whose taste and tactile sensation was tailored to each Israelite in
        an age-appropriate manner.<span className="SuperScript">34</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <br/><br/>
        </div>
        <div className="PDFBody">
        Thus Rabbi Moshe Hayyim Efraim draws on a well-established tradition
        linking manna and Torah, but he extends and develops it with his self-reflective examination of the process of exegesis, which he says depends on intuiting
        connections between seemingly arbitrary features on the surface and hidden
        riches below. This points to something often missed about ParDeS, the four-faceted system of interpretation from the Middle Ages.<span className="SuperScript">35</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; What may have been
        tacitly understood by many kabbalists and what the hasidic master now makes
        explicit is that the four levels dovetail, buttressed and undergirded by the belief
        in scripture as an organic, integrated whole. Kabbalistic and hasidic readings
        are symbolic, to be sure, but the symbols are not adventitiously chosen or haphazardly deployed. Surface texture and deep significance project onto each
        other reciprocally because all layers are encased in a relational latticework that
        is intuited by the reader for whom the pattern is organically consistent.
        More broadly, the Baal Shem Tov’s parable and Rabbi Moshe Hayyim
        Efraim’s application of it may be seen as an effort to preempt a critique of
        hasidic exegesis. Already in the rabbinic period, as Christine Hayes has shown,
        the Babylonian amoraim “felt a deep ambivalence about non-contextual or
        midrashic methods of exegesis.”<span className="SuperScript">36</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; This anxiety about midrashic exegesis left
        its traces in discussions of peshat versus derash in the medieval period, and
        may have been felt with particular acuity by hasidic masters, whose techniques were perceived by some to be especially idiosyncratic and eccentric.
        The skepticism about hasidic exegesis carries forward into the modern period.
        Louis Jacobs, a twentieth-century rabbinic scholar basically sympathetic to
        Hasidism wrote the following: “Hasidic ‘Torah’ can hardly be described as exegesis. The texts are taken
        completely out of context to yield the desired conclusions; ideas are read into the texts that by no stretch of the imagination can
        they possibly mean; grammar and syntax are completely ignored; there is not
        the slightest indication of any awareness of the historical background.”<span className="SuperScript">37</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; As if
        in response to the implied critique of hasidic readings, Rabbi Moshe Hayyim
        Efraim asserts that they speak to those for whom their message is addressed.
        This approach is obviously circular, but the rabbi would no doubt see this as
        a virtuous circularity: persons comprehend surface features whose depth they
        already intuit, whose message in some sense they already own.<span className="SuperScript">38</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;

        The Centrality of Personhood

        </div>
        <div className="PDFBody">
        Scholarship on hasidism has tended to focus on mystical states and the relationship of yesh [being] and ayin [naught], to the relative neglect of the individual
        personality. But the interpretive dynamics of early hasidism depend crucially
        on the personhood of the interpreter engaging with the personality of Torah,
        effectively identical with the personality of God. The hasidic interpreter not
        only applies a method, but also explores and reveals the personal aspect of self
        and of Torah, in dialogue with each other. To be sure, the mystical teachings—
        omnipresence of God, illusory nature of evil, the creation of the world anew
        every moment—frame and influence the teachings, but it is also true that the
        masters celebrate the individuality of interpretation as reflecting the stamp of
        each unique personality.
        <br/><br/>
        </div>
        <div className="PDFBody">
        In his work on Kabbalistic interpretation, Idel has explored the mystical
        idea of “primordial spiritual roots and corresponding interpretations,” and is
        careful to state that even when the infinitude of interpretations is asserted,
        together with the belief that the soul of each Israelite holds a facet of Torah,
        there may be “no special veneration of the uniqueness of the individual;
        the soul is conceived of as but part of the greater spiritual reservoir of primordial
        souls, which are no more and no less than sparks of the divine essence which
        descended into the mundane world and will return to their supernal source
        at the end of time.”<span className="SuperScript">39</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; He does note that as the history of Kabbalah unfolds,
        a more subjective perspective emerges, with an emphasis on the “contribution
        of the individual” to the fullness of interpretive possibilities.<span className="SuperScript">40</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; The parable of
        the Degel Mahaneh Efraim shows that it is in Beshtian hasidism that this trend
        flowers to its fullness. Just as Gershom Scholem has noted in regard to early
        hasidism, that the doctrine of uplifting the sparks takes a “definite, personal,
        and intimate turn,”<span className="SuperScript">41</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; here as well, interpretation is an intimate, personal quest
        to find what is one’s own, what truly belongs to one’s individual self and therefore to the infinitude of divine possibilities.

        All this confirms the observation of Steven T. Katz that “[E]xegesis . . . is a
        way of learning theurgical practices that can influence God or the Ultimate;
        a primary form, a main channel, of mystical ascent; a basic source of spiritual energy; a performative mystical act with salient experiential—transfor-
        mational—consequences; a way of defining one’s mystical path; and a way to
        meet and interact with God or the Ultimate(s).”<span className="SuperScript">42</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Even (perhaps especially) at
        the moment of encounter with the Absolute, the individual comes most into
        her/his self.

        19 The first occurrence of the word for son/child is missing a yod signifying the plural, but
        since all later mentions of offspring in the parable clearly refer to a plurality of children, it
        must be assumed that the dropped yod is a misprint or the word was written in truncated,
        abbreviated form, a common printer’s habit of the time.

        29 	Moshe Idel has discussed another passage by Rabbi Moshe Hayyim Efraim relevant to this
        parable. See his Kabbalah: New Perspectives (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1988),
        245, where he quotes the following: “[A] person who is righteous is close to the Torah
        and . . . the Torah is in him and he is in the Torah.” As Idel writes, “The study of Torah is
        here regarded as a restoration of the human body through its purification, culminating
        in a mystical union with the Torah, which dwells upon the sanctified members.” But this
        is not the interpretive personalism of our parable. See also the discussion in Alan Brill,
        “The Spiritual World of a Master of Awe: Divine Vitality, Theosis, and Healing in the Degel
        Mahaneh Ephraim,” Jewish Studies Quarterly 8 (2001): 51–57, who, following Idel, correctly
        emphasizes that for the Degel, pneumatic inspiration is the basis of Torah interpreta-
        tion. However, he does not explore the personalist dimension. Roland Goetschel, “Torah
        lishmah as a Central Concept in the Degel mahaneh Efrayim of Moses Hayyim Ephraim of
        Sudylkow,” in Hasidism Reappraised, ed. Ada Rapoport-Albert (London and Portland, OR:
        Littman Library of Jewish Civilization, 1996), 258–67, discusses techniques of meditation
        on and manipulation of the Hebrew letters as modes of engaging Torah, but does not
        discuss our topic.64

        31 	This crucial point distinguishes our parable from another parable with which it shares
        some features. I refer to the parable Parashat Behar in Rabbi Jacob Joseph of Polonnoye
        Toldot Ya’akov Yosef, vol. 3 (1780, reprint Monroe, NY: S. Weiss, 1998), 468–69, in which
        the Seven Pillars of Secular Wisdom are palace treasures visible to all, hence seized by
        ‘servants,’ while the deep treasure, understood as religious piety, is hidden by the king in
        the palace walls. The favored son, having been alerted in advance by the king, is able to
        notice a slight irregularity in the wall, which he proceeds to demolish, and uncovers the
        hidden treasure. In Rabbi Jacob Joseph’s parable (which he attributes to an ambiguously
        identified “Moharaz”), there is once again the contrast between the beloved son and the
        servants, who evidently do not enjoy the same level of intimacy with the king. In addition,
        the game is stacked in favor of the son, because he is told ahead of time of the existence of
        the most precious treasure, while the servants—oblivious to the existence of any hidden
        treasure—have no chance of finding it.Hasidic Derashah as Illuminated Exegesis

        erally understood to mean that only those not burdened by the cares of livelihood and
        with sufficient leisure can devote themselves to Torah study, but it actually may refer to
        the fact that “manna was absorbed in their bodies,” as the midrash puts it, so that the
        ingestion of the heavenly food transformed their bodies, making them appropriate ves-
        sels to comprehend and expound the Torah.

        38 	This is closely related to what Moshe Idel calls the “dearcanization” of exegesis in Hasidism.
        By this he means the shift from disclosure of a body of esoteric gnosis, to direct, transfor-
        mative religious experience. In Hasidism the very notion of a body of ‘secrets’ is derided
        in favor of tasting divinity directly. See Moshe Idel, Absorbing Perfections: Kabbalah and
        Interpretation (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 2002), 181–85.Hasidic Derashah as Illuminated Exegesis

        40 	Ibid., 100. Elsewhere Idel writes that “[t]he attenuation of the role of kabbalistic theo-
        sophical terminology, sometimes by its psychological reinterpretation, enable the
        Polish Hasidism to regain some of the charm of midrashic discourse” (“Midrashic versus
        Other Forms of Jewish Hermeneutics: Some Comparative Reflections,” in The Midrashic
        Imagination, ed. Michael Fishbane, [Albany, NY: State University of New York Press,
        1993], 55). He notes that the Midrash is “expressly dominated by a personalistic view of
        God.” Ibid., 49. This means that in framing hasidic theology and exegesis, one should not
        overemphasize metaphysical categories such as Yesh and Ayin; the personalities of God,
        Torah, and the interpreter are always in the foreground.
