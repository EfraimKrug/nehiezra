            Rabbi Shneur Zalman’s Tanya has become an iconic book, published
            in facsimile editions in towns and cities all over the world as an act
            of piety and talismanic protection. Its chapters have been divided
            into lectionary readings to be studied as a canonical text on a fixed
            schedule. Beginning students in Chabad houses are sometimes given
            Tanya as a gift; in its pages they receive their initial exposure to kabbalistic-Hassidic
            ideas and terminology, indeed to Judaism itself as
            understood by Chabad Hassidism.
            But the original goal of Tanya was very different, and its initial
            publication was a response to the needs of a different social setting.

            <div className="PDFBody">
            Tanya’s appearance in 1796 reflects the transition of Hassidism
            from its early period, when a small group of devotees surrounded
            charismatic illuminates, to a larger movement with a defined social
            structure and a self-conscious identity vis-à-vis the wider Jewish
            world. In this second phase, which emerged after 1772, the movement
            was organized around masters, or tzaddikim, each of whom
            held sway in a relatively well defined geographical area, enjoying
            the allegiance and veneration of passionate followers, known as hassidim.
            <span className="SuperScript">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Each tzaddik was known for a certain style of teaching and
            sacred service, whose elements formed a unique spiritual signature.
            It is around this time that we see the emergence of Hassidic courts,
            supported by donations from followers. And it is shortly after this
            time that we first observe the phenomenon of dynastic succession,
            with a tzaddik founding a hereditary line.

            Among the most successful courts was that of Rabbi Shneur
            Zalman of Liadi, whose following was so large that rules were instituted
            to regulate and restrict access to the court and the master<span className="SuperScript">2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;In
            this context, the publication of Likkutei Amarim, or Tanya,.<span className="SuperScript">3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;in 1796,
            plays a key role in the ascendancy of Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi
            and the rise of Chabad Hassidism, and in shaping the communal
            structure of Chabad.

            Likkutei Amarim / Tanya is one of very few works of early Has-
            sidism that was actually written by the nominal author and brought
            to publication in the author’s lifetime and under his direction. It
            is also one of very few works of early Hassidism that, rather than
            conveying its ideas in the form of occasional homilies linked to Bib-
            lical texts or the festival cycle, presents a sustained exposition and
            makes a highly structured argument<span className="SuperScript">4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;While the special character of
            Tanya has long been recognized, the compositional strategies and
            the developmental unfolding of the book have not been sufficiently

            The importance of the book in Rabbi Shneur Zalman’s Chabad
            Hassidism is asserted in the hakdamat ha-melaket, the “compiler’s
            foreword” to Tanya. Rabbi Shneur Zalman announces his intention
            to have the book replace personal audiences:

            be preserved as a sign-post and to serve as a visual reminder
            for each and every person, so that he will no longer press for
            admission to private conference with me. For in these [writ-

            matter that he finds difficult in the service of God. His heart
            will thus be firmly secured in the Lord, Who completes every-

            The assertion of absolute comprehensiveness is surely striking, espe-
            cially in light of Rabbi Shneur Zalman’s acknowledgment, just prior
            to this statement in the foreword, that a universal written response
            to personal religious questions is a theoretical impossibility. In its
            self-confidence and self-assurance of total coverage of a domain of
            analysis, this foreword is reminiscent of Maimonides’ introduction
            to the Mishneh Torah, with the added feature that the author an-
            nounces his intention that any questions about the advice in Tanya
            be referred to a network of disciples who will explicate its teaching.
            In this way, the book would serve as a resource that would largely
            replace person-to-person contact with the master, since “time no
            longer permits of replying to everyone individually and in detail on
            his particular problem.”

            The foreword does not tell us what questions Rabbi Shneur
            Zalman’s hassidim addressed to him, but to judge by Tanya itself,
            they apparently were prompted by the gradual erosion of the illu-
            mination that had characterized Hassidism’s earliest period, when
            religious exuberance reigned by virtue of partaking in a new and
            vital religious dispensation<span className="SuperScript">6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;During the formative years, religious
            devotion seemed to come effortlessly and without resistance, in an
            intense glow of new discovery and excitement. By the 1790s, as the
            movement spread and the number of followers increased dramati-
            cally, routinization had set in, with all its vexing obstacles to the re-
            ligious life. In early Hassidism it had seemed as if human nature had
            been born again; its motto could have been (to borrow from William
            Wordsworth) “Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive, / But to be young

            was very heaven!” By the 1790s, however, despite (or perhaps because
            of) the geographic spread and numerical growth of the movement,
            the glow and buoyancy of the early days were receding. It was this
            that impelled large numbers of Rabbi Shneur Zalman’s followers
            to seek out their master, to express their puzzlement at the gradual
            attenuation of exuberant spirituality, and to register their dismay at
            the return of the daily struggle with temptation.

            <div className="PDFBody">
            The structure of Tanya deserves some comment. The book
            begins with a presentation of several early rabbinic texts, whose
            juxtaposition reveals (in good pilpulistic fashion) an apparent con-
            tradiction. In order to resolve the contradiction, the author proceeds
            to reconfigure the standard moral categorization of tzaddik and
            rasha (“righteous” and “wicked”), terms that go back to the Bible. By
            the time he has finished his exegetical reshaping, the entire moral
            landscape has changed; the spiritual topography has shifted, and no
            boundary marker has been left untouched. It takes fourteen chapters
            for this seismic shift to work itself out, and when it does, the aver-
            age reader might be forgiven if he forgets the questions that had
            launched the exploration back in Chapter 1. But the author has not:
            he returns to the issues he raised fourteen chapters before and, by
            his lights, resolves them decisively. Ancillary questions are treated
            in the following chapters until the Sefer Shel Beinonim, or “Book of
            Intermediate Individuals,” Tanya’s first section, concludes. The entire
            effect is one of total mastery, total control; the reader feels he has
            been led lovingly, knowingly, firmly through a transformative jour-
            ney by a leader who foresaw the outcome with total clarity from the
            outset. This is a tour de force that compels the reader by the power of
            argument, but even more by the power of the mind, which advances
            it<span className="SuperScript">7</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;One is hard pressed to think of another Hassidic work anywhere
            that presents such a sustained, cogently set out argument as Sefer Shel
            Beinonim, with its long development arch cresting to a conclusion
            that is both triumphant and inevitable. Since its appearance, readers
            from all camps Hassidic, maskilic, and academic have expressed
            admiration for the style of Tanya no less than its substance.
            <br/><br/>
            </div>
            <div className="PDFBody">
            It is hardly an accident that Tanya begins with a Talmudic
            passage on the administration of an oath. According to a beraita
            cited in Niddah 30b, every individual is given an oath before birth,
            adjuring him to “be righteous and not wicked; and even if the whole
            world tells you that you are righteous, regard yourself as if you were
            wicked.” The fact that the author chooses this passage to open his
            work makes clear that his essential theme is duty, the obligation of
            the individual to fulfill his responsibility. The hassid is enjoined to
            act as a tzaddik acts that is, with perfect rectitude, in complete con-
            formity with the dictates of the Torah and the 613 commandments.
            He may be mistaken by others for a tzaddik, a Hassidic saint, but
            inside he knows that he still struggles with temptation; hence the
            need for the oath, suggesting resolute commitment and unwavering
            attentiveness. The fact that the individual is under oath raises the
            stakes of the religious life, in that failure or even a simple misstep
            is not simply wrong, but is a violation of a solemn pledge. And the
            fact that an oath is required underscores the reality that the average
            person is in constant danger of succumbing to temptation and needs
            the oath to bind him to his mission.
            <br/><br/>
            </div>
            <div className="PDFBody">
            The question arises, Of all the topics in the religious life in
            general and Hassidism in particular, why did Rabbi Shneur Zalman
            consider the redefinition of tzaddik/rasha to be of such crucial im-
            portance as to devote his seminal work on Hassidism, the only one
            to be published in his lifetime, to it? Why the need to develop and
            amplify the category of beinoni (a term that does not appear in the
            Bible and does not play a central role in most Talmudic presenta-
            tions of religious typology) to such a degree? And why the need to
            make the category of tzaddik virtually impossible to attain? Before
            Tanya, the tzaddik was commonly understood to be an individual
            in whom virtue dominates over vice, whose good deeds outweigh
            his sins. But for Tanya, to have any sins at all consigns one to the
            category of rasha, wicked. To be a tzaddik, one must not only be free
            of sin, but free of any temptation to sin, to be so bathed in divine
            grace and light that one is drawn unceasingly to the good. Tanya
            explicitly teaches that the category of tzaddik is virtually unattain-
            able by one’s own effort<span className="SuperScript">8</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>
            </div>
            <div className="PDFBody">
            The answer to these questions appears to be that the primary
            goal of Tanya is to explain to the devotee that he is not a tzaddik and

            should surrender hopes of becoming one. The stratification of the
            Hassidic world and the emergence of a clear hierarchy, which were
            ongoing at this time, were given a powerful justification by the ap-
            pearance of Tanya. The category of beinoni is completely revised. No
            longer is the beinoni a person whose virtues and demerits are roughly
            in balance. Rather, the beinoni is a person who knows temptation
            but never succumbs to it. The beinoni is thus in constant struggle,
            and that is a good thing, for God delights in the victory of good over
            evil, and merit accrues to the individual from his unceasing victory
            over baser urges<span className="SuperScript">9</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>
            </div>
            <div className="PDFBody">
            Images of struggle and conquest occur frequently in Tanya. The
            hassid is a warrior in constant battle against the evil inclination<span className="SuperScript">10</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;The body is called a “small city,” over which the divine soul and the
            animal soul fight. To be sure, there are respite moments, when, in
            an intense effort of concentration, the beinoni cultivates a state of
            God-consciousness, but these are achieved during recitation of the
            Shema and the Amidah, after which the essence of the animal soul
            and its propensities returns. The respite moments serve to maximize
            the spiritual possibilities available to the beinoni, while at the same
            time they keep the distinction between the beinoni and the tzaddik
            sharp and clear, since only for the tzaddik is the suffusion of being
            with God-consciousness permanent and unceasing.

            </div>
            <div className="PDFBody">
            In this way, Tanya is carefully crafted to exploit the tension
            between control and empowerment. The book makes it clear that
            the tzaddik is a different order of being than the hassid. Maximalist
            demands are placed upon the beinoni/hassid, who is expected to
            behave in thought, word, and deed like a tzaddik, but who yet is
            told that there is little if any possibility that he might ever become a
            tzaddik. This framework empowers the hassid to become a warrior
            for Hassidism, but essentially precludes any aspiration on the part
            of the hassid to become a leader himself.

            The reconfiguration of the meaning of tzaddik / beinoni / rasha
            that Tanya effects, creates a new spiritual landscape, one unlike what
            is found in the writings of contemporary Hassidic masters. For Rabbi
            Shneur Zalman, the tzaddik is another order of existence, absolutely
            separated by nature from the average individual. This spiritual
            topography is not to be found in the writings of R. Levi Yitzhak of
            Berditchev, for example, where there is no indication that the tzaddik
            is set off metaphysically from the average individual. Even a work
            like R. Elimelekh of Lyzhansk’s Noam Elimelekh, with its powerful
            presentation of the role of the tzaddik, makes it clear that the tzaddik
            is not beyond struggle<span className="SuperScript">11</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>
            </div>
            <div className="PDFBody">
            Rabbi Shneur Zalman’s desire to distinguish the tzaddik from
            the beinoni, whose destiny is perpetual struggle, is so strong, that
            he asserts that a key passage in the Shema, “that you seek not after
            your own heart and your own eyes, after which you go astray,” <span className="SuperScript">12</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;does
            not refer to the tzaddik. Rabbinic tradition understands this verse
            as an admonition to resist the temptations of heresy and sexual sin.
            But since the tzaddik has no temptation at all, this verse cannot refer
            to him<span className="SuperScript">13</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>
            </div>
            <div className="PDFBody">
            The message of Tanya is sober yet reassuring: the initial era of
            Hassidism, the era of boundless illumination and spiritual exuber-
            ance, is over. The animal nature has reasserted itself, as we should
            have known it would, but there is essential, valuable work to do. That
            work can be done as long as the hassid remains faithful to his task
            and condition as beinoni, faithful to the oath he took before he was
            born. In sum, we are arguing that Tanya must be understood as a
            period piece, a response to a movement’s transition from youth to
            maturity. Rabbi Shneur Zalman wrote a book that would make clear
            the division of labor that would prevail in Hassidism’s mature phase,
            defining and patrolling its internal boundaries.
            Part ii of Likkutei Amarim–Tanya, called Shaar ha-Yihud ve-ha-
            Emunah (“The Gate of Unity and Faith”), is a clear exposition of early
            Hassidism’s acosmic theology<span className="SuperScript">14</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;As Naftali Loewenthal and others
            have pointed out, Rabbi Shneur Zalman’s original intention was
            apparently to place Shaar ha-Yihud ve-ha-Emunah before Part i, an
            arrangement that would have given further emphasis to the acosmic
            view. As we have it, Tanya’s main thrust lies more with the struggle
            and conquest of Part i than with the vision of unity of Part ii<span className="SuperScript">15</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;As it
            stands, Part ii serves to buttress the Sefer Shel Beinonim, reminding
            the hassid that God is everywhere, thus emboldening him to act with
            courage and confidence in every circumstance and location. The

            total effect is not one of mystical ecstasy, but motivation to action.<span className="SuperScript">16</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;The potent rhetorical strategy of Tanya, simultaneously augmenting
            the poles of control and empowerment, coupled with the mystical
            theology of God-in-all-places and God-in-all things (but downplay-
            ing ecstatic illumination) provokes the reader into action and fosters
            a posture of fearlessness and militancy.

            The appearance of Tanya evoked comments from other leaders
            in the world of Hassidism, notably R. Avraham Kalisker, who wrote
            a sharply critical letter to Rabbi Shneur Zalman in 1797, shortly after
            the appearance of Tanya.<span className="SuperScript">17</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I must respectfully differ from the
            approach of Naftali Loewenthal in his Communicating the Infinite.<span className="SuperScript">18</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;In Loewenthal’s view, the essential innovation of Rabbi Shneur Zal-
            man is his development of a systematic method of presentation of
            esoteric ideas. Loewenthal writes that “R. Avraham Kalisker criti-
            cized the idea of making esoteric teachings available to the ordinary
            members of the Hassidic fraternity.... In R. Avraham’s view the at-
            tempt manifested by the Tanya methodically to communicate these
            teachings was dangerous.”

            </div>
            <div className="PDFBody">
            I would present R. Avraham’s objections a bit differently. The
            project of Tanya was dangerous because it was a retrograde move-
            ment from the teachings of the Besht and the Maggid, as R. Avraham
            saw them. In his view, the words of the Maggid were moments of
            illumination, epiphanies that could not be encased in a structure of
            systematic thought without doing violence to their essential char-
            acter. For R. Avraham Kalisker, the concern is not so much with the
            promulgation of esoteric teachings, but rather with the assumption
            that such promulgation is possible.

            <div className="PDFBody">
            In the view of R. Avraham, the communal structure that Tanya
            fostered was problematic in two respects: in its aspect of control,
            and in its aspect of empowerment. In the aspect of empowerment,
            it enabled an ever-widening circle of followers of uncertain spiritual
            attainments to believe they could be teachers and transmitters of
            authentic Hassidic teachings. For R. Avraham, only someone who
            had already attained a sublime spiritual state could be safely empow-
            ered to promulgate the teachings. On the other hand, at the pole of
            control, R. Avraham’s view was that here Rabbi Shneur Zalman had
            narrowed the domain of the tzaddik nearly to the vanishing point it
            was a set that appeared to have room only for a single exemplar. Here
            we must recall R. Avraham’s emphasis on dibbuk haveirim, where a
            small circle of initiates shares spiritual insights with one other, and
            help one another along the path, but with little or no emphasis on
            the role of a tzaddik as a singular figure.19

            <div className="PDFBody">
            For R. Avraham Kalisker, then, the pole of empowerment in
            Tanya spread the dimensions of the circle much too broadly, while
            the emphasis on control restricted the inner circle much too nar-
            rowly. R. Avraham Kalisker’s vision of the Hassidic community was
            much smaller than that of Rabbi Shneur Zalman’s, but it was a vision
            of community without walls, without formal structure, without (in
            his view) unnecessary theoretical scaffolding, without rigid demar-
            cation lines and that did not a priori exclude anyone from joining
            its most inner circle. Kalisker’s opposition to Tanya was not a reflex
            reaction to the promulgation of esoterica, but a principled affirma-
            tion of what he saw as the essential contribution of the Hassidism of
            his teachers to Jewish spirituality, and which was in danger of being
            eroded by a theoretical systemization that paralleled the imposition
            of a stratified and regimented social structure.

            Ha-sayyif ve-ha-sefer yardu kerukhim min ha-shamayyim, “the
            sword and the book came down together from heaven.”20 In the
            case of Tanya, the book was a sword; a powerful weapon that every
            individual hassid could wield against his own animal nature and
            employ to great effect in the task of moral and spiritual growth.
            Tanya also was and is a potent weapon that the Chabad movement
            could employ to overcome opposition within the world of Has-
            sidism, on the part of the Mitnagdim, the capricious turns of tsarist
            policy, the winds of Haskalah, secularism and modernity, as well as
            the cruel, relentless, and naked power of the Stalinist Soviet regime.
            Of all the Jewish traditional movements and institutions in tsarist
            Russia and the Leninist-Stalinist onslaught that followed, Chabad
            Hassidism was arguably the one that stood up best to the terrors,
            holding ground where it seemed impossible to do so. And in the
            much more benign times of the post–World War II period, Chabad
            has grasped the opportunities for external growth and expansion,

            creating a network of outposts staffed by devotees who subordinate
            their personal comfort and even their spiritual growth in favor of
            the urgent needs of the movement.

            As the foundational work of this religious movement, Tanya
            achieved enormous success and has been of inestimable influence.
            It must be recalled, however, that the initial purpose of Tanya was
            not the promulgation of mystical doctrines, much less the teach-
            ing of mystical techniques or practices, but the stratification and
            regimentation of the Hassidic community and the assignment of
            appropriate roles. The strictures of R. Avraham Kalisker might
            alert us to possibility that Tanya’s success may have been achieved
            at some cost to the original vision of Hassidism, and that both the
            control and the empowerment may not be entirely consistent with
            the social vision and unstructured illuminations of the movement’s
            earliest leaders.

            Leader,” Tarbiz 54:3 (1985): 429–439. Etkes states that Rabbi Shneur Zalman emerged
            as the principal leader of White Russian hassidim only after 1789, about a year after
            the death of Rabbi Menahem Mendel of Vitebsk in 1788 (Etkes, p. 439). See also
            idem, “Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Lyady as a Hassidic Leader,” Zion 50 (1985): 321–353,
            where Etkes presents his analysis of the “Liozna Regulations,” which severely limited
            visits to the master and gave priority to newcomers over veteran hassidim.

            3. The name Tanya is a popular designation that simply reproduces the first word of
            the work. It does not appear on the title page of the first edition (Slavuta, 1796),
            which gives the name as Likkutei Amarim (“Collected Discourses”); see Naftali
            Loewenthal, Communicating the Infinite: The Emergence of the Chabad School
            (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1990), p. 47. See also Likkutei Amarim: First
            Versions (New York: Kehot, 1981).
            Loewenthal’s discussion of Tanya is significantly augmented in his essay “Rabbi Shneur
            Zalman of Liadi’s Kitzur Likkutei Amarim British Library Or 10456,” in Studies in
            Jewish Manuscripts, ed. Joseph Dan and Klaus Herrmann (Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck,
            1999), pp. 89–137. Loewenthal notes that the manuscript he is analyzing “preceded
            the printed book” (p. 114), and that its title is Kitzur Likkutei Amarim (“Abridgement
            of Collected Discourses”), but he does not address the significance of this title
            (which also appears in other early manuscripts). It is puzzling that a work not yet
            published is called an “abridgement.” I hope to address this in a subsequent essay.

            6. Rabbi Israel Hapstein (1737–1814), the Maggid of Kozienice, was one of the found-
            ers of Hassidism in Poland. He writes that he once saw the Baal Shem Tov in a
            dream and asked him why “when I began my service [in Hassidism] and entered
            the circle of tzaddikim to learn from their deeds...I felt a daily change for the good
            in my Torah study and prayer...but now I feel no change. It seems that each day
            is like the day before and the day after.” See Sefer Avodat Yisrael, Parashat Shemini,
            end. This description of personal experience, when projected onto the movement
            as a whole, does much to explain the structural transformations of this period, to
            which Tanya was one response.

            7. I am reminded here of Robert Nozick’s observation in the introduction to his
            Philosophical Explanations (Cambridge. Mass.: Belknap Press of Harvard University
            Press, 1981). The older philosophical style, which Nozick calls “coercive philosophy,”
            tries to force assent to its conclusions by the power of its arguments. This stands
            in contrast to Nozick’s approach, which explains how certain beliefs and views are
            possible but without attempting to coerce, retaining wonder and puzzlement.

            8. The one qualification here is the passage at the end of chap. 14, which allows that
            after unceasing effort, “perhaps a spirit from above might descend upon him, and
            he will merit something of the spirit that is rooted in some tzaddik that will be
            impregnated within him, so that he may serve God with true joy.” For the doctrine
            of “impregnation” (ibbur), see Lawrence Fine, Physician of the Soul, Healer of the
            Cosmos: Isaac Luria and His Kabbalistic Fellowship (Stanford: Stanford University
            Press, 2003), p. 434 n. 73. Fine writes that ibbur “occurs for a temporary period of
            time, until the impregnated soul accomplishes its goal.” If so, the ontological divide
            between tzaddik and beinoni in Tanya’s system is not really breached.

            but nevertheless may experience pride and ego-involvement, and may fall quickly

            Kabbalistic Theosophy of Chabad Hassidism, trans. Jeffrey M. Green (Albany: State
            University of New York Press, 1993).
            My understanding of Tanya is consistent with the view articulated by Rivkah Schatz-
            Uffenheimer in “Anti-Spiritualism ba-Hassidut,” Molad 171–172 (1962): 513–528,
            who argues that Tanya is not a popularization of the teachings of the Maggid
            of Mezhirech but a retreat from them. Her views have been criticized by Isaiah
            Tishby and Joseph Dan, who argue that the teachings of Tanya are exoteric, while
            Rabbi Shneur Zalman’s esoteric theology is to be found in such works as Torah Or
            (Kopys, 1837) and Likkutei Torah (Zhitomir, 1848). (The views of Tishby and Dan
            were published in their essay on Hassidism in the Hebrew Encyclopedia, 17:775).
            Be that as it may, it remains true that Tanya was the only work of Hassidic teach-
            ings by Rabbi Shneur Zalman published in his lifetime. He clearly had an intense
            interest in the appearance of the work, and the publication project was under his
            direct supervision. Thus Tanya remains the only official, authorized text of Chabad
            Hassidism as a movement, as envisioned by the movement’s founder.
