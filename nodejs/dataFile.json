This section is about the Chatas - or 'sin offering'. These sections are clearly addressed to all of b'nai Yisroel, and they describe a system of communication between b'nai Yisroel and Hashem with the Kohanim as facilitators for that communication. As you read it, pay attention to WHO the actors are, and exactly what they are doing and when 'rai'ach ni'cho'ach' is actualized.","otherabout":"","othercitation":"","othersefer":""}]
